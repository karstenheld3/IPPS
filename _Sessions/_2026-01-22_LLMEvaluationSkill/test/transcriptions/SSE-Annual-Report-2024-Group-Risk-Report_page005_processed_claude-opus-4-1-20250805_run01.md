### Climate Change

**Risk trend:** ↑ (arrow)
**What is the risk?** The risk that SSE's strategy, investments or operations are deemed to have an unacceptable future impact on the natural environment and on national and international targets to tackle climate change.

**Link to strategy:** Develop, Operate, Build, Invest (all four circles filled)

**Material influencing factors:**
- Adverse weather events causing damage or interrupts energy supply or generation
- Speed of technology and policy developments
- Politicisation of climate issues for the UK General Election, coupled with slow progress on government policy towards meeting and implementing net zero commitments
- Global and domestic policies including those published by the UK's Committee on Climate Change relating to the Sixth Carbon Budget for the period 2033 to 2037

**Key mitigations:**
- Climate Change Policy and Sustainability Policy
- Clear commitment to our strategy, driving climate-related performance with measurable reporting
- SSE assesses the climate impact on its operations over the short, medium and long term from the perspective of market, policy or regulatory shifts, risks and opportunities and the physical impacts of a changed climate
- Political and regulatory engagement
- SSE is engaging in decarbonising infrastructure over a five-year period to FY27 as part of its NZAP Plus
- SSE's Net Zero Transition Plan sets out the key actions SSE will take to drive progress towards Net Zero and zero ambitions
- SSE provides transparent disclosures of its governance around climate-related risks and opportunities
- SSE is assessing its resiliency remuneration reflects the role of sustainability and climate-related considerations within SSE's purpose and strategy, with sustainability-linked metrics and targets an element of performance against net SSE under the UK's new Climate Hazard and Accounts

**Developments this year:**
- Over the year controls across adaptation planning and reporting sustainability assessment criteria within Large Capital Projects programs, and sustainable procurement procedures have been strengthened. These improvements have subsequently driven a reduction in the potential impact of this Principal Risk to the Group
- NZAP Plus refreshed issued in June 2023 to £20.5bn (in prices) from £18bn (based on increasing visibility over Transmission spend and associated supply chain costs
- Continued delivery for a supportive environment encouraging investment in low carbon generation
- 2023/24 saw SSE's lowest scope 1 green house gas emissions
- Partner ahead of key climate roundtable and risk management can be found on pages 100 to 105 ⬤ of the Annual Report and Accounts

### Cyber Security and Resilience

**Risk trend:** ↑ (arrow)
**What is the risk?** The risk that key infrastructure, networks or core systems are compromised or are otherwise rendered unavailable.

**Link to strategy:** Develop, Operate, Build, Invest (all four circles filled)

**Material influencing factors:**
- Software or hardware issues, including telecoms networks, connectivity and power supply interruption
- Third party security of cyber attacks due to geopolitical events
- Increased sophistication and likelihood of ransomware attacks
- Improved and strengthened performance, for example, breach of information security rules or poor management of resilience expertise
- Employee and contractor understanding and awareness of information security requirements
- Malicious cyber attack
- Increased third party suppliers and joint venture heightening our risk

**Key mitigations:**
- Cyber Security Policy and Data and Information Management Policy
- Key technology and infrastructure risks are incorporated into the design of systems
- Significant investment from third-party testing of the security of business and operational technology networks and systems
- Continued strengthening and embedding of the cyber risks and controls framework to continue to identify threats and reduce exposures
- Service level agreements for business-critical IT services in place
- Business continuity plans are reviewed in response to changes in the threat to the Group and regularly tested

**Developments this year:**
- Geopolitical unrest resulting in continued heightened threat level
- Significant longer-term Security Programme investment to strengthen the position of SSE resilience
- Thorough review of Business continuity and Disaster Recovery plans
- Implementation of Network Information Systems (NIS) regulations are embedded infrastructure
- Continued focus to modernise the IT estate

### Energy Affordability

**Risk trend:** ↑ (arrow)
**What is the risk?** The risk that energy customers' ability to meet the costs of providing energy, or their ability to access energy services is limited, giving rise to negative political or regulatory intervention that has an impact on SSE's regulated networks and energy businesses.

**Link to strategy:** Develop, Operate, Build, Invest (all four circles filled)

**Material influencing factors:**
- Technology changes and innovations to develop sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy
- Public opinion and perception of profits
- Public policies, including those aimed at reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption
- Accessibility of social and related services for all
- Increased focus on energy security in response to current geopolitical events
- Reduced investment in the upgrading of the electrical infrastructure to achieve net zero
- Fluctuations in the cost of fuels
- Perceptions regarding utilities and related bad debt

**Key mitigations:**
- SSE Sustainability Policy
- Robust stakeholder engagement across government, regulators, consumer representatives and policymakers
- Adopting and implementing government support mechanisms across multiple jurisdictions
- Affordability schemes to support financially vulnerable customers
- Long-term price forecasting

**Developments this year:**
- Energy prices, whilst historically high, have seen a reduction in consumer prices this year
- Continued financial and for consumer policies will help bring forward necessary investment in low-carbon infrastructure at lowest cost to reduce customers' exposure to energy price volatility and deliver net zero affordably
- SSE Airtricity introduced two consecutive domestic tariff reductions in Ireland and regulated tariff reductions have been introduced in Northern Ireland
- SSE Business Energy established a £15m targeted support fund for business customers
- SSE Airtricity continued to Consumer Vulnerability Strategy in March 2024

### Energy Infrastructure Failure

**Risk trend:** ↑ (arrow)
**What is the risk?** The risk of national energy infrastructure failure, whether in respect of assets owned by SSE or those owned by others which SSE relies on, that prevents the Group from meeting its obligations.

**Link to strategy:** Develop, Operate, Build, Invest (all four circles filled)

**Material influencing factors:**
- Longer-term changes in climate patterns cause sustained higher temperatures that may impact in lower rainfall and reduced water supply to hydro generation assets
- Government policy regarding the operation of the energy network including capacity at GB links
- Suitability and quality of Great Britain's and European critical infrastructure
- Appropriate asset management and necessary upgrading works of both generation and network assets
- Energy network balancing mechanisms to balance supply and demand on Great Britain networks
- Malicious attack on energy infrastructure
- Continued availability of technical skillset and competency

**Key mitigations:**
- SSE Sustainability Policy
- Investment strategies to attract technical skillset and experience to SSE Business & Build assets
- Business Unit Asset Management Policies
- Dedicated Engineering Centres of Excellence devise and develop plans to ensure the ongoing delivery of its investment assets
- Targeted investment plans to ensure the ongoing health and integrity of network assets
- Crisis management and business continuity plans are tested regularly and are designed for the management of, and recovery from, significant energy infrastructure failure events
- Active participant in national security forums such as the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI)
- SSE plans to deliver flexible new low-carbon capacity to play a critical role in the UK over net zone ambitions, involving security of supply across the UK

**Developments this year:**
- Elevating geopolitical unrest potentially leading to global security threats, cyber threats and supply chain challenges
- SSE's Transmission continues to be balanced on GB to ensure customers' electricity supplies as safely and quickly as possible
- Regulatory and political consensus around the importance and benefit of energy system, investment to ensure capacity and resilience in the energy system
