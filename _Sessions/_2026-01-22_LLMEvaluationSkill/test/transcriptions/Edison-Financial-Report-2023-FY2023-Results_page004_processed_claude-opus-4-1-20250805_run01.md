### Key Metrics (Left side indicators):
- 🇮🇹 Italy flag
- **-2.7%** at 308.4 TWh
- **+19.2%** Net import
- **+11.2%** Other RES prod.
- **+35.5%** Hydro prod.
- **-17.4%** Thermo prod.

### Italian Power Demand Details:
**ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%)** satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%:
- ✓ Renewables cover 30% of demand:
  - ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
  - ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity
- Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports

### PUN (Power Price):
**PUN at 127.2 €/MWh** (FY2023 average),
**-58.1% vs FY2022**
