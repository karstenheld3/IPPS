# Power Solutions – Q4 2023
Positive earnings in Power Solutions for the first time since 2021

## Highlights

**Revenue increased by 2 percent YoY.** A decline in Offshore revenue was more than offset by higher Onshore revenue, driven by South America and Australia. There was a 5 percent currency headwind in the quarter.

**EBIT margin b.s.i. returned to positive territory with 3.3 percent** in the quarter. The increase was primarily driven by better project pricing and execution, contributions from our Development business, and lower warranty provisions compared to last year.

**Profitability continues gradual improvement** but is still held back by execution and completion of low-margin projects from the backlog
