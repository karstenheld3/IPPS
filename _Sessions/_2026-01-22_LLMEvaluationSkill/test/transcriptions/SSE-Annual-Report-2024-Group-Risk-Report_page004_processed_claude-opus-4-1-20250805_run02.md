# Group Principal Risks

## Risk Appetite

The Group risk appetite aligns to the achievement of SSE's Strategic Goals. SSE will only accept risk where it is consistent with its core purpose, strategy and values is well understood, can be effectively managed, is in line with stakeholder and societal interest and commensurate reward.

The key feature of SSE's Strategic Framework is its commitment to SSE's Strategy, Goals and Values, as well as the focus it brings to creating value and the reflective of its risk appetite.

Fundamental:
- SSE has a clear strategy to create value for shareholders and society in a sustainable way by developing, building, operating, and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero.

In determining its appetite for specific risks, the Board is guided by three key principles:

1. Risks should be consistent with SSE's core purpose, financial objectives, strategy and values;
2. Risks should only be accepted where relevant approvals have been attained through the Governance Framework to confirm appropriate levels of employees on the basis of evidence and in a manner that is consistent with SSE's purpose, strategy and values; and
3. Risks should be actively controlled and monitored through the effective allocation of management and other resources, underpinned by the maintenance of a healthy business culture.

SSE's Board has overall responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the risk it is willing to take to achieve strategic objectives and for ensuring that risks are managed effectively across the Group.

## Identifying and assessing climate opportunities and risks

SSE's Group Risk Management Framework is complemented by a specialist TCFD climate assessment that identifies and assesses climate opportunity and risk in the short (to 2030), medium (to 2040) and long-term (to 2080). These three climate-related time horizons are chosen to align with the Investment Capital and regulatory time horizons that govern SSE's financial, operational and capital plans.

The climate risk assessment involves senior business leader interviews supported by ongoing Business Unit risk assessments to capture and understand climate opportunities and risks. A materiality test is completed, and a final list of significant climate opportunities and risks defined.

SSE then identifies the climate impact on its operations over the short and medium term from the perspective of market, policy or regulatory, transition opportunities and risks, and over the medium and long term from the perspective of the physical risks of climate change.

Materiality is tested for each climate opportunity or risk based on its ability to have a substantive economic financial impact on SSE's strategy or its significant impact on SSE's stakeholders. In 2023/24, the assessment process reconfirmed that the material climate-related opportunities and risks identified for pages 102-103 in SSE's Annual Report and Accounts remained relevant to SSE.

## Managing climate opportunities and risks

SSE's System of Internal Control defines the policy, standards and governance for the management of all risks, including those relating to climate. The system involves the critical controls that are in place to manage risk including climate risk. Controls include business continuity plans, crisis management and incident response, large capital project governance and internal and external assurance.

The climate-related opportunities and risks (pages 100 to 105 of the Annual Report and Accounts), combined with SSE's Sustainability Report 2024 and CDP Climate Change response provides further information on these actions and controls.

## Integrated climate-related risk assessment

SSE's Group Risk Management Framework (page 112 of the Annual Report) and Accounts) manages risks that can threaten the achievement of SSE's strategic objectives, including climate change.

Climate change is a Group Principal Risk to SSE and has the ability to affect the achievement of agreed strategic objectives and the long term success of SSE (see page 90 of the Annual Report and Accounts). Scenarios related to physical risks associated with climate change form part of SSE's viability assessment (page 13). Climate-related influencing factors and key developments will also consistently influence all relevant Group Principal Risks.

## Developments this year

A transition to net zero is SSE's core Group Principal Risks has increased to 12 this year, with the addition of newly formed 'Supply Chain' risk. A higher global demand for renewable technology, combined with a drive to increase supply, will result in fewer but larger, drive both increased costs and supply chain capacity constraints, leading to project feasibility implications or impacting delivery timescales. Additionally, SSE must balance climate and nature risks where these are not compromised. All of these factors have the potential to affect a number of the other Principal Risks.

The nature of the world and operating environment which SSE finds itself is subject to intrinsically linked. Acknowledging the interconnectivity of the risks validates the need to broaden coverage and attention to the Group Risk profile and to ensure the System of Internal Control (pages 112 of the Annual Report and Accounts) continues to support the delivery of SSE.

Cyber Security and Resilience remains an enduring and a high likelihood principal impact. Whilst a strong and continuously evolving control environment is in place, protecting SSE from this threat, the impact attack remains a top priority. Evolving the Group's technology provides critical support to the essential in continuing to manage this risk.

The Portfolio Exposure risk also remains unchanged with a high likelihood of commodity and foreign exchange risks in a year where high commodity prices resulted in increases to customer requirements. Key activity gave rise to high returns. This year whilst volatility has reduced, ongoing pricing instability, evolving domestic elections and supply chain restrictions mean the potential return of commodity volatility and remains.

The actions taken this year around the review on pages 4 to 12. In particular, Climate Change has resulted in a reduction in materiality. Both these risks are closely linked with Political and Regulatory Change. Whilst the potential likelihood of political and regulatory change has increased due to potential outcomes of elections in the countries where SSE operates, the risk has reduced. SSE has confidence that the strategy is aligned with the UK government decarbonising ambitions, and this is therefore reflected in the risk rating.

A minor change has also been made to the definition of Speed of Change Principal Risk, acknowledging that climate action may now a constant that requires continuous adaptation and resilience to ensure the Group's strategic direction is maintained.

The Principal Risks are mapped for providing insight to the relative impact and likelihood of each.

Further detail of SSE's Principal Risks including the material influencing factors for management and the mitigations throughout this year that have driven risk scoring can be found on pages 8 to 12.
