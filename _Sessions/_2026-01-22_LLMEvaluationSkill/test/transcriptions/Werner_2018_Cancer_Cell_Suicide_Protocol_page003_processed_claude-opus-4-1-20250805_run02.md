## Cancer Cell Suicide Protocol:

1. **Sequence** the molecular natural genome (mNG) of the cancer cell. Output : A digital natural genome (dNG)

2. **Translate** the digital natural DNA code dNG into digital artificial DNA code (dAG) of the Cancer-CAD software

3. **Analyze, simulate, search and edit** the artificial genome network dAG
   a. **Find and Analyze** the cancer causing networks in dAG.
   b. **Edit** the cancer networks within dAG by **inserting and linking** in the death signal dADs link into one or more of the cancer loops in dAG.
   c. **Result:** The artificial cancerous genome dAG has been transformed in dAG* that express that activates the cell death pathway (apoptosis).

4. **Reverse Translate** the artificial death signal dADs into the digital natural code dNDs*.

5. **Insert and link** the digital natural death signal-code dNDs* into the digital natural genome dNG to create the transformed digital genome dNG* that expresses the natural version of the death signal dNDs*.

6. **Synthesize** the molecular death signal-code mNDs* using the natural digital natural death signal-code dNDs* as a template.

7. **Use CRISPR to insert and link in** the molecular death signal-code mNDs* into the corresponding cancer network within the natural molecular genome mNG to transform it into the genome mNG* that activates the cell death pathway.

8. **Result :** The molecular natural genome mNG of the cancer cell has been transformed into a genome mNG* where the cancer network now activates the synthesized death signal-code mNDs* which in turn activates the cell death pathway leading to cell apoptosis.
