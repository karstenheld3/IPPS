This example is adapted from [33].

In this linear network, a cell of type A is a 1st-order, linear stem cell. It produces progenitor cells of type B that have a stochastic dedifferentiation potential. The cell B can either dedifferentiate to its parent state A or differentiate into the terminal cell T. The lower the probability p of dedifferentiation, the greater the number of terminal cells in the cell population generated by the stem cell A. The higher the probability p the more the network approaches the topology of a pure exponential network with explosive cell proliferation. Thus the topology of the network is a pragmatic topology (see below) that depends on the probability distribution. The effect of the probability distribution is shown in the following example adapted from [33]:

(a) Probability p = 0.52, gives 4% stem cells
(b) When p = 0.7 gives 36% stem cells  
(c) Probability p = 0.9 gives 80% stem cells

All three tumors are controlled by a similar network as in (Fig. 2). It shows the growth response to changes in the probability p. As the probability p is increased, more and more stem cells are generated due to increasing dedifferentiation of the daughter cells to their parent stem cell. The stochastic exponential network begins to dominate as p approaches 1. Example is adapted from the classic Till network [21] as formalized in [33].
