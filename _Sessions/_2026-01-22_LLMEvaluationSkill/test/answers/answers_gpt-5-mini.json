      "category": "hard_reasoning",
      "reference_answer": "The tumor mass increases by accumulating Blue terminal cells (so total mass expands) while the number of proliferating cancer cells remains low (1–4); thus the composition shifts toward non-proliferating terminal cells even though active cancer cell proliferation does not increase.",
      "model_answer": "Mainly shifts composition: the cancer cells do not proliferate (only 1–4 red cells), so the tumor expands by converting cells into passive blue terminal cells rather than increasing the number of cancer cells.",
