## User Prompts

### Initial Request (2026-02-27)

I want to explore the possibility to set up OpenClaw on my machine so I can interact with it remotely via WhatsApp. But also through Cascade.

Questions:
1) What is OpenClaw aimed for? Which scenarios, use cases, applications?
2) On Windows: How can it be set up, dependencies, limitations, security considerations.
3) What are the features? Complete list with examples.
4) What communication channels are supported?
5) How can it be integrated into Windsurf Cascade? Skill? MCP? Workflow?
6) What would be the best way for a remote and local machine to interact with the same data when both have OpenClaw installed? Scenario: Mobile Laptop on / off, Remote machine always on. How to sync files? Dropbox? Git? Alternatives? We would need ultra fast file sync. What other challenges will we face? I want to start work on laptop and hand over tasks to remote machine for long-running jobs.
