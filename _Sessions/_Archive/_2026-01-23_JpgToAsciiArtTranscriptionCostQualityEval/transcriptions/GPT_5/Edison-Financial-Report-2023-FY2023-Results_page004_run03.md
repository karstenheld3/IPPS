# POWER Edison – Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

(TWh)

-2.7% at 308.4 TWh

+19.2%  Net import
+11.2%  Other RES prod.
+35.5%  Hydro prod.
-17.4%  Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.
• Renewables cover 30% of demand:
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity
• Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due to higher imports.

- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~66x20 characters
- ASCII captures: Italy flag as three vertical stripes; central blue pill with overall demand change; four color-coded ovals with percentage changes and labels.
- ASCII misses: Exact colors and rounded oval shapes; shading and gradients.
- Colors:
  - Green/White/Red – Italian flag
  - Yellow – Net import
  - Green – Other RES prod.
  - Blue – Hydro prod.
  - Dark/Navy – Thermo prod.
- Layout: Flag above; large central pill below; four ovals stacked vertically with associated labels to the right.
- Details: Typography and exact icon styling not shown.
- Data: -2.7% at 308.4 TWh; +19.2%; +11.2%; +35.5%; -17.4% with respective labels.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine colored ovals next to labels under an Italy flag, with a central blue pill highlighting total demand change.

- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~88x28 characters
- ASCII captures: Two stacked bars with totals (37,1 and 37,7), segment values (14,2; 2,3; 2,2; 17,6; 0,77 and 15,7; 1,4; 1,9; 18,0; 0,69), and annotated percentage changes between the bars (-1.5% +12.4%, -2.1%, +63.4%, +14.7%, -9.3%). Legend maps colors to categories.
- ASCII misses: Exact bar widths, colors, and precise segment heights; corporate logo styling.
- Colors:
  - Dark blue – Thermoelectric production
  - Light blue – Hydroelectric production
  - Green – Wind & other renewables production
  - Orange – Other purchases (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.)
  - Grey – Edison Next
- Layout: FY2023 bar on left, FY2022 bar on right; small grey cap on top of each; annotations placed between bars at heights matching segments.
- Details: Rounded edges and subtle gridlines not shown.
- Data: All numerical labels and inter-year deltas reproduced exactly as shown.
- Reconstruction hint: Visualize two stacked columns with the specified values and color legend; the left shows less dark blue and more blue/green than the right.
