# POWER Edison – Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

(TWh)

-2.7% at 308.4 TWh
+19.2% Net import
+11.2% Other RES prod.
+35.5% Hydro prod.
-17.4% Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.
- Renewables cover 30% of demand:
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity
- Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports.

<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~115x50 characters
- ASCII captures: 
  - The slide's layout with a left context panel (Italy), and two groups of stacked bar charts titled "SOURCES" and "USES".
  - Numerical totals per bar (37,1 and 37,7), segment values (e.g., 0,77; 17,6; 14,2; 22,6; 13,7), and inter-year percentage change annotations (-1.5%, +12.4%, -2.1%, +14.7%, +63.4%, -9.3%, -0.9%, -3.1%).
  - Legends for both chart groups and the footnote (1).
  - Presence of the EDISON EDF GROUP logo text and the lightning icon (as a note).
- ASCII misses:
  - Exact colors of stacked segments and ovals, gradient/shading, and brand logos.
  - The Italian flag graphic is indicated generically as [Flag ITA] without colors.
  - Visual thickness/relative heights of segments are schematic, not to scale.
- Colors:
  - Dark blue = Thermoelectric production
  - Light blue = Hydroelectric production
  - Green = Wind & other renewables production
  - Orange = Other purchases (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.)
  - Grey = Edison Next
  - Light green (in USES) = Other sales (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.)
- Layout:
  - Left panel with national context and bullets.
  - Center "SOURCES": two vertical stacked bars for FY2023 (left) and FY2022 (right), with change annotations placed between them.
  - Right "USES": similarly structured stacked bars with change annotations.
  - Totals shown at the top of each bar; grey mini-segment for Edison Next at the very top.
- Details:
  - All numeric labels, percentages, footnote markers, and headings as shown in the image are preserved verbatim (including comma decimals).
  - A small lightning icon near "(TWh)" exists; represented textually.
- Data:
  - SOURCES FY2023 segments: 0,77; 17,6; 2,2; 2,3; 14,2; total 37,1.
  - SOURCES FY2022 segments: 0,69; 18,0; 1,9; 1,4; 15,7; total 37,7.
  - USES FY2023 segments: 0,77; 22,6; 13,7; total 37,1.
  - USES FY2022 segments: 0,69; 22,8; 14,2; total 37,7.
  - Changes: -1.5% (total), +12.4% (Edison Next), -2.1% (Other purchases), +14.7% (Wind & RES), +63.4% (Hydro), -9.3% (Thermo), -0.9% (End customers), -3.1% (Other sales).
- Reconstruction hint:
  - Imagine two side-by-side groups of vividly colored stacked columns with precise numeric labels; left group labeled "SOURCES," right group labeled "USES." A gray side panel on the left shows Italy flag and bullet points with percentage ovals. The aesthetic is corporate (EDISON EDF GROUP) with blue/green/orange palette.
