# How we create value

Our business model

We are developing, building, operating and investing in our unique portfolio of assets across the electricity value chain.

## How we are structured

Index-linked earnings from economically-regulated networks offset inherent risk in market-facing businesses

Renewables | Flexibility | Networks

SSE Renewables  
Providing clean and affordable home-grown energy

SSE Thermal  
Balancing the market with flexible generation

SSEN Transmission  
Enabling net zero by connecting renewables to centres of demand

SSEN Distribution  
Bringing net zero to the doorstep by decarbonising streets and homes

Energy products and services

Energy Customer Solutions  
SSE Airtricity and SSE Business Energy provide a shopfront for the Group’s renewable generation output

SSE Enterprise  
Bringing low-carbon solutions to business-to-business markets

SSE Energy Markets  
Trading commodities, securing value for SSE’s assets and managing volatility

Corporate services  
Providing cost-effective shared services and strategic direction across the Group

Key:  
- Market-based businesses  
- Economically-regulated businesses

SSE has a very deliberate mix of market-based and economically-regulated businesses that span the clean energy value chain. The Group’s synergies and natural hedges, along with our world-class assets and balance sheet strength, enable us to create lasting value in a highly complex operating environment.

For a better world of energy

## What we do

## The relationships and resources we rely on

Employees  
Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.

Energy customers  
Consumers create demand for our energy and services.

NGOs, communities and society  
We need the support of the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.

Natural environment  
From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to build energy infrastructure, natural resources are essential to what SSE does.

Shareholders and debt providers  
SSE must be well financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates, and invest in growing the business.

Government and regulators  
We rely on policy frameworks and public services that support investment in critical national infrastructure. [Remaining text not legible in source image.]

Suppliers, contractors and partners  
We rely on a healthy supply chain with the capability to deliver large projects and innovative, efficient ownership structures. [Portions of the original sentence not fully legible in source image.]
