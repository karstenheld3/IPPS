<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~108x34 characters
- ASCII captures: The four vertical phase panels, their titles, subtitles, and all step text; the top progress/navigation labels with a page indicator "(3)".
- ASCII misses: Background photography and gradients; fine typography and spacing; diagonal decorative text elements; thin separator lines above the navigation.
- Colors:
  - Blue (deep) - PHASE 1 panel background
  - Cyan/light blue - PHASE 2 panel background
  - Purple/magenta - PHASE 3 panel background
  - Orange/peach - PHASE 4 panel background
- Layout: A horizontal sequence of four equal-width panels beneath a slim horizontal navigation/progress guide. Each panel stacks: phase label, main heading, subtitle, then steps.
- Details: No icons within the panels; background includes abstract shapes and a faint plus icon, not represented in ASCII.
- Data: Steps 1–12 exactly as shown, including punctuation and wording; navigation labels: Introduction, Get ready, Onboard and engage, Deliver impact, Extend and optimize, Next steps; page number "3".
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine four colored vertical cards aligned left-to-right with bold black headings and smaller body text; a thin top rule with navigation labels spaced along it and a page number at far right.
