<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: approximately 120x33 characters
- ASCII captures: 
  - Four side-by-side phase columns with titles and step lists.
  - Top navigation items and page number "3".
  - Presence of a faint diagonal helper text line.
  - High-level background cues and a plus icon indicator.
- ASCII misses:
  - Exact fonts, sizes, and precise spacing.
  - Rounded corners, transparency, and soft shadows.
- Colors:
  - Phase 1: deep blue.
  - Phase 2: cyan/sky blue.
  - Phase 3: magenta/purple.
  - Phase 4: peach/orange.
  - Background: pastel gradients with abstract shapes; white UI bar with a blue circular plus icon at top-right.
- Layout:
  - Navigation bar across the top; diagonal helper text overlays near the top.
  - Four equal-width vertical columns from left to right labeled PHASE 1 to PHASE 4.
  - Each column contains a heading, a short descriptive subtitle, then steps.
- Details:
  - The helper text reads: "use to reference people, files and more" with the initial symbol obscured in the original.
  - Subheadings and step sentences end with periods as shown.
- Data:
  - Steps numbered 1 through 12 across phases.
  - Page number displayed: 3.
- Reconstruction hint:
  - Imagine a modern slide with four brightly colored vertical panels over an abstract gradient background; simple top navigation text with separators and a faint diagonal UI helper string.
