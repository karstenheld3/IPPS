# How we create value — Our business model

We are developing, building, operating and investing in our unique portfolio of assets across the electricity value chain.

Balancing the market with flexible generation

Networks

SSEN Transmission
Enabling net zero by connecting renewables to centres of demand

SSEN Distribution
Bringing net zero to the doorstep by decarbonising streets and homes

Energy products and services

Energy Customer Solutions
SSE Airtricity and SSE Business Energy provide a shopfront for the Group’s renewable generation output

Key:
• Market‑facing businesses
• Economically‑regulated businesses

SSE has a very deliberate mix of market‑based and economically‑regulated businesses that span the clean energy value chain. The Group’s synergies and natural hedges, along with our world‑class assets and balance sheet strength, enable us to create lasting value in a highly complex operating environment.

SSE — For a better world of energy

What we do

We drive progress towards net zero by developing, building, operating and investing in clean, secure and affordable electricity infrastructure needed for the energy system of tomorrow.

The relationships and resources we rely on

Employees
Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.

Energy customers
Consumers create demand for our energy and services.

NGOs, communities and society
We need the support of the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.

Natural environment
From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to build energy infrastructure, natural resources are essential to what SSE does.

Shareholders and debt providers
SSE must be well financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates, and invest in growing the business.

Government and regulators
We rely on policy frameworks and public services that support investment in critical national infrastructure and maintain the momentum behind net zero.

Suppliers, contractors and partners
We rely on a healthy supply chain and work with partners whose capabilities support our vision, innovative project delivery and efficient ownership structures.

  short value propositions, top explanatory arrow about index-linked earnings, energy
  products/services row, corporate services bar, and a legend indicating two business types.
- ASCII misses: Original colors and icons (wind turbine, plant, pylons, homes, etc.);
  precise color-coded legend circles; exact typography.
- Colors:
  - Teal/green bars for section headings and legend keys.
  - Dark blue boxes for categories; lighter blues for services.
- Layout: Three top columns (Renewables, Flexibility, two Networks), then a row of three
  product/service boxes, then a full-width corporate services bar. A horizontal arrowed
  caption spans the top.
- Details: Icons inside each box (e.g., wind turbine for Renewables) are not rendered.

- Reconstruction hint: Imagine a circular flow with four evenly spaced stages connected by
  curved arrows; each stage has a small icon.
