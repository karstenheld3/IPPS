# POWER Edison – Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

(TWh)

-2.7% at 308.4 TWh

+19.2%  Net import  
+11.2%  Other RES prod.  
+35.5%  Hydro prod.  
-17.4%  Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%;
- Renewables cover 30% of demand:
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity
- Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports.

€ PUN at 127,2 €/MWh (FY2023 average), -58.1% vs FY2022
