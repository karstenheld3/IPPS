<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~110x55 characters
- ASCII captures: Title, regions, city labels with USD prices, grouping by continent/region, relative ordering, footer/source notes.
- ASCII misses: Circular globe maps, radial bar lengths, country flags, exact color coding, geographic coastlines, decorative typography, app store icons.
- Colors:
  - Blue = North America
  - Green = Latin America
  - Pink = Asia
  - Orange = Oceania
  - Light pink = Middle East
  - Teal = Europe
  - Yellow = Africa
- Layout: Original uses multiple circular maps: NA at upper-right; LatAm to its lower-right; large Asia ring bottom-left; small Oceania ring to Asia’s right; Middle East ring between Asia and Europe; large Europe ring bottom-right with a small UK ring; small Africa ring bottom-left.
- Details: Bars radiate outward with city names and prices; small national flags precede many labels; subtle world map silhouettes inside each circle.
- Data: Prices are monthly rents for a three-bedroom apartment in the city center, in USD, as of June 2025; source attribution to Numbeo (via Deutsche Bank) and note that the rent data is user-submitted (crowdsourced).
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine each region as a circular mini-map with outward spokes where longer spokes correspond to higher rents; use the color legend above to map each region.
