# POWER Edison – Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

(TWh) ⚡

---
-2.7% at 308.4 TWh

+19.2%   Net import

+11.2%   Other RES prod.

+35.5%   Hydro prod.

-17.4%   Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.  
• Renewables cover 30% of demand:  
   ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall  
   ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity  
• Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports.

€ PUN at 127,2 €/MWh (FY2023 average),

<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~70x30 characters
- ASCII captures: Main bar heights, color-coded layers, labels for each segment, indication of segments and FY years, relative position/source-layers, and labels, and % changes.
- ASCII misses: Actual color representation (uses labels), logo, fine visual gradients, minor tick marks. Does not show subtle differences in bar width/palette or pictorial representations (e.g. country flag).
- Colors:
    - [Dark blue] – Thermoelectric production
    - [Light blue] – Hydroelectric
    - [Green] – Wind & renewables
    - [Orange] – Other purchases/end customers
    - [Gray] – Edison Next
    - [Yellow] – Other sales
- Layout: Two main clusters of bars (Sources, Uses), paired for FY2023 and FY2022, with values stacked vertically to reflect composition.
- Details: All percentage changes are listed, with change direction (up/down), all critical data segments have numeric values as shown in original, and structure enables comparison.
- Data: Numeric values taken verbatim, as presented on the figure.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine modern stacked bar chart, color coded by energy source with YoY arrows/percentages alongside bar pairs.
