- Dimensions: 114x15 characters
- ASCII captures: The 4-phase structure, clear columns with respective steps, explicit phase labels, and stepped action items per phase. 
- ASCII misses: Color background gradients (blue, cyan, purple, orange), graphical blending and smooth transitions, any icons and textures present in original image, background pattern, navigation bar or number cues.
- Colors:
  - Blue: Phase 1
  - Cyan: Phase 2
  - Purple: Phase 3
  - Orange: Phase 4
- Layout: Four equal vertical columns laid side by side, each labeled with Phase number, main theme, subtitle, and ordered action steps beneath.
- Details: Omits photorealistic cachet, glossy overlays, and 3D graphical elements visible in the source.
- Data: All step names and descriptions, phase titles, order, and segment grouping are fully represented.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine each phase column as a colored panel, steps stacked top-to-bottom inside, reading left-to-right for overall process flow.
