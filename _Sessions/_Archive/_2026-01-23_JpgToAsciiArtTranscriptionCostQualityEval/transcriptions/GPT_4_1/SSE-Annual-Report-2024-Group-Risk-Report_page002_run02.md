### The relationships and resources we rely on

**Employees**  
Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.

**Energy customers**  
Consumers create demand for our energy and services.

**NGOs, communities and society**  
We need the support of the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.

**Natural environment**  
From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to build energy infrastructure, natural resources are essential to what SSE does.

**Shareholders and debt providers**  
SSE must be well financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates and invest in growing the business.

**Government and regulators**  
We rely on policy frameworks and public services that support investment in critical national infrastructure, are customer and nature driven, and maintain the momentum behind net zero.

**Suppliers, contractors and partners**  
We rely on a healthy supply chain and work with partners with the capability to deliver innovative projects and efficient ownership structures.
