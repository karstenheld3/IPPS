- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: 114x27 characters
- ASCII captures: The overall four-phase segmented layout, each phase title and steps, spatial grouping and order, with emphasis on process flow (left-to-right).
- ASCII misses: Color backgrounds (blue, cyan, purple, orange for phases), graphical transitions between phases, subtle gradients, photographic background.
- Colors:
  - Blue: Phase 1
  - Cyan: Phase 2
  - Purple: Phase 3
  - Orange: Phase 4
- Layout: Four colored vertical segments, each representing a key phase, from left to right.
- Details: Original uses a clean modern font; icons or minor UI embellishments are omitted. Top background is abstract with pastel gradients.
- Data: All phases and steps, including the actions and focus of each, listed verbatim.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine four rectangles laid horizontally, each a different pastel color, with succinct phase and step summaries per section.
