# POWER Edison – Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

(TWh)

---

## Left Text Box

-2.7% at 308.4 TWh

+19.2%   Net import  
+11.2%   Other RES prod.  
+35.5%   Hydro prod.  
-17.4%   Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.  
• Renewables cover 30% of demand:  
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall  
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity  
• Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports.  
€ PUN at 127,2 €/MWh (FY2023 average), **-58.1% vs FY2022**

- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: approx. 90x32 characters
- ASCII captures:
   - Block arrangement and value heights for each category across FY2023 and FY2022 for both SOURCES and USES.
   - Distinct regions for each source/use type, showing relative magnitude.
   - Annotations for all numeric labels, matching bar heights to captions.
- ASCII misses:
   - Exact color coding. (Described in legend)
   - Actual graphical layout (bars are not really shaded or colored).
   - Company logos, Italian flag image.
   - Fine gradients, font sizes.
   - Exact layout/alignment between categories.
- Colors:
   - Blue: Thermoelectric production
   - Light blue: Hydroelectric production
   - Green: Wind & other renewables
   - Orange: Other purchases/End customers
   - Grey: Edison Next
- Layout:
   - Four vertical stacked bars, two 'Sources' (left) and two 'Uses' (right), for FY2023 and FY2022, each annotated with values and categories.
- Details:
   - Numeric and percentage change annotations between years.
   - Legends embedded for bar meanings.
   - Footnote marker (1) present in both source and use bars.
- Data:
   - 37.1, 37.7, 17.6, 18.0, 0.77, 0.69, 2.2, 2.3, 1.9, 1.4, 14.2, 15.7, 22.6, 22.8, 13.7, 14.2 as given.
- Reconstruction hint:
   - Imagine a group of stacked bar charts (two for sources, two for uses), with color bands denoting different energy production/purchases and customer uses, heights corresponding to TWh, and side annotations for changes.
