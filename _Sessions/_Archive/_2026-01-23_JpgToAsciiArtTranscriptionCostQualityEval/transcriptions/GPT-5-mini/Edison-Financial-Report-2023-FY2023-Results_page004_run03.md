POWER Edison – Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

(TWh)

-2.7% at 308.4 TWh

+19.2%     Net import
+11.2%     Other RES prod.
+35.5%     Hydro prod.
-17.4%     Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.
• Renewables cover 30% of demand:
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity
• Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports

- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: 71x20 characters (approx; width x height of ASCII block)
- ASCII captures: Italian flag placeholder, main blue oval "-2.7% at 308.4 TWh", four percentage ovals with associated labels, the bullet statements about Italian power demand and renewables, the PUN line, and Edison credit.
- ASCII misses: Exact visual ovals, flag colors (green/white/red), typography, spacing and proportional layout, checkmark glyph styling and small icons/logos.
- Colors:
  - Blue oval - highlights overall change (-2.7% at 308.4 TWh)
  - Yellow/green/blue/gray ovals - represent Net import, Other RES prod., Hydro prod., Thermo prod.
- Layout: Left-side vertical info panel; flag at top, stacked ovals, descriptive bullets below, financial line and logo at bottom.
- Details: Precise font sizes, colored outlines, and small graphic logo replaced by text labels.
- Data: Percentages and numeric values preserved exactly as transcribed.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine a vertical panel with a small Italian flag on top, a prominent blue oval showing "-2.7% at 308.4 TWh", then four colored ovals each with "+19.2%", "+11.2%", "+35.5%", "-17.4%" and labels to the right, followed by bullet text describing demand and the PUN value.
