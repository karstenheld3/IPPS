POWER Edison – Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

[Left panel content]
(Italian flag image)

-2.7% at
308.4 TWh

+19.2%      Net import

+11.2%      Other RES prod.

+35.5%      Hydro prod.

-17.4%      Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.
• Renewables cover 30% of demand:
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity
• Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports.

<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~70x18 characters (ASCII region shown)
- ASCII captures: Italian flag placeholder, central blue oval with "-2.7% at 308.4 TWh", the four statistic ovals with their percentage labels and short descriptions, the main paragraph texts exactly as in slide, the PUN price lines, the footnote "(1) Before line losses", and the Edison logo label.
- ASCII misses: exact oval shapes, flag colors (green-white-red), colored fill of ovals (blue, yellow, green, dark blue), typographic styling, spacing and alignment as in original; exact small checkmark glyph design (rendered as [✓]); logo graphic detail.
- Colors:
  - Blue oval - main overall change stat (-2.7% at 308.4 TWh)
  - Yellow oval - +19.2% Net import
  - Light green oval - +11.2% Other RES prod.
  - Blue-green oval - +35.5% Hydro prod.
  - Dark navy oval - -17.4% Thermo prod.
- Layout: Flag at top left, prominent large blue oval below it, then a vertical list of four colored ovals with percentage and short label to their right, followed by a paragraph block of notes about Italian power demand and PUN price, then Edison logo and footnote at bottom-left.
- Details: The text block contains bullet points and two checkmark bullets. Numeric formats use commas for decimals (e.g., 127,2 €/MWh).
- Reconstruction hint: Visual emphasis is on the blue oval (-2.7% at 308.4 TWh) and color-coded ovals indicating changes in imports, RES, hydro, and thermo. The paragraph below explains demand composition and drivers.

<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~70x18 characters (ASCII bar chart)
- ASCII captures: Two stacked columns labeled FY2023 and FY2022, top totals "37,1" and "37,7" with small top block values "0,77" and "0,69", stacked segment labels and values for Edison Next, Other purchases, Wind & other renewables, Hydroelectric production, Thermoelectric production. The between-columns percentage change annotations are represented as lines below the bars.
- ASCII misses: Exact bar widths, true stacked proportions, colors (original uses distinct colors for each segment: dark blue for thermoelectric, blue for hydroelectric, green for wind, orange/red for other purchases, grey for Edison Next), gradient and bar visuals, axis lines, exact vertical spacing and numeric placement, small typography differences.
- Colors:
  - Thermoelectric production - dark blue (bottom segment; FY2023=14,2; FY2022=15,7)
  - Hydroelectric production - blue (next segment up; FY2023=2,3; FY2022=1,4)
  - Wind & other renewables production - green (FY2023=2,2; FY2022=1,9)
  - Other purchases (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.) (1) - orange/red (FY2023=17,6; FY2022=18,0)
  - Edison Next - grey (top small block; FY2023=0,77; FY2022=0,69)
- Layout: Two side-by-side stacked bars with segment values annotated. Percentage change annotations sit between/next to segments indicating relative variations (e.g., -1.5% top, -2.1%, +14.7%, +63.4%, -9.3%).
- Details: Numeric formatting uses commas as decimal separators. Footnote marker (1) applies to "Other purchases (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.)".
- Reconstruction hint: Visualize two stacked bars equal total height ~37 TWh with different internal segment heights; thermoelectric is largest bottom component, other purchases large orange middle segment, hydro and wind relatively small increases, Edison Next negligible small top sliver.

<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~70x14 characters (ASCII region)
- ASCII captures: Two stacked bars for FY2023 and FY2022 with totals 37,1 and 37,7; top small Edison Next block values 0,77 and 0,69; middle orange "End customers" values 22,6 and 22,8; bottom lime "Other sales" values 13,7 and 14,2. Percentage change annotations to the right of the stacks (-1.5% +12.4%, -0.9%, -3.1%) are included.
- ASCII misses: True color fills (lime/orange/grey), exact stacked proportion visuals, small font and alignment, small "(1)" footnote applied to End customers label in original legend, and subtle spacing/line-art details.
- Colors:
  - Other sales (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.) - lime/green (FY2023=13,7; FY2022=14,2)
  - End customers (1) - orange (FY2023=22,6; FY2022=22,8)
  - Edison Next - grey (small top sliver; FY2023=0,77; FY2022=0,69)
- Layout: Two adjacent stacked bars with three segments each; percentage delta annotations listed to the right correspond to top total change and per-segment changes.
- Details: Numeric formats use commas as decimal separators; footnote marker (1) appears in legend with End customers.
- Reconstruction hint: Envision two ~37 TWh columns with large mid orange block for end customers and a significant lower lime block for other sales; Edison Next is a small top sliver.
