<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~111x29 characters (ASCII art block is 111 characters wide by 29 lines high)
- ASCII captures:
  - Four main panels laid out left-to-right representing Phase 1 (blue), Phase 2 (cyan), Phase 3 (purple), Phase 4 (orange).
  - Each panel's title (PHASE X:), main heading, short description, and listed steps with their text.
  - Relative column grouping: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 appear as three equal-height panels above a wider Phase 4 panel at bottom-right in the original image; ASCII renders them in a single block with Phase 4 below the others to reflect available horizontal space.
  - Top-of-slide elements transcribed in text above the figure: "Your Copilot adoption roadmap", diagonal ribbon text "use to reference people, files and more", navigation labels "Introduction   Get ready   Onboard and engage   Deliver impact   Extend and optimize   Next steps" and page number "3".
- ASCII misses:
  - Color, gradients, and subtle background artwork and shadows.
  - Exact typography (fonts, weights, sizes) and precise spacing/kerning.
  - Decorative elements such as the circled plus icon at top-right and decorative diagonal ribbons.
  - Fine visual effects (gloss, light reflections, soft edges).
- Colors (visual only, noted here for reconstruction):
  - Blue panel (Phase 1) - represents "Get ready"
  - Cyan/turquoise panel (Phase 2) - represents "Onboard and engage"
  - Purple/magenta panel (Phase 3) - represents "Deliver impact"
  - Orange/peach panel (Phase 4) - represents "Extend and optimize"
- Layout:
  - Main title appears top-left.
  - Decorative diagonal ribbons run across the top area with small diagonal text.
  - A navigation row across the top center lists the slide sections; "Introduction" is visually emphasized in the original.
  - The four-phase content occupies the central area as vertical colored panels; Phase 1/2/3 are aligned side-by-side, Phase 4 is to the right.
- Details:
  - Each phase contains numbered steps (Step 1..12) with short instructional lines.
  - Some steps are arranged visually in two sub-columns within a panel (e.g., Steps 1/3 left and Steps 2/4 right in Phase 1); ASCII groups these to indicate relative placement.
- Reconstruction hint:
  - To imagine the original, picture a wide slide with pastel abstract background and four tall colored cards (blue, cyan, purple, orange). Cards contain bold headings and smaller body copy listing steps. The top contains a navigation line and soft diagonal graphic with small gray text.
