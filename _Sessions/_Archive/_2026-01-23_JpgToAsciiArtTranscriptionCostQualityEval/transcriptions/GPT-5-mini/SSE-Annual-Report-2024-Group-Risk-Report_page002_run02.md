# Our business model

How we create value

Our business model

We are developing, building, operating and investing in our unique portfolio of assets across the electricity value chain.

How we are structured | What we do | The value we create

Index-linked earnings from economically-regulated networks offset inherent risk in market-facing businesses

Renewables        Flexibility        Networks

SSE Renewables
Providing clean and affordable home-grown energy

SSE Thermal
Balancing the market with flexible generation

SSEN Transmission
Enabling net zero by connecting renewables to centres of demand

SSEN Distribution
Bringing net zero to the doorstep by decarbonising streets and homes

Energy products and services

Energy Customer Solutions
SSE Airtricity and SSE Business Energy provide a shopfront for the Group's renewable generation output

SSE Enterprise
Bringing low-carbon solutions to business-to-business markets

SSE Energy Markets
Trading commodities, securing value for SSE's assets and managing volatility

Corporate services
Providing cost-effective shared services and strategic direction across the Group

SSE has a very deliberate mix of market-based and economically-regulated businesses that span the clean energy value chain.
The Group's synergies and natural hedges, along with our world-class assets and balance sheet strength, enable us to create lasting value
in a highly complex operating environment.

1 Managing risk and uncertainty

What we do

We drive progress towards net zero by developing, building, operating and investing in clean, secure
and affordable electricity infrastructure needed for the energy system of tomorrow.

Develop -> Build -> Operate -> Invest (cycle)

The relationships and resources we rely on

Employees
Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.

Energy customers
Consumers create demand for our energy and services.

NGOs, communities and society
We need the support of the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.

Natural environment
From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to build energy infrastructure, natural resources are essential to what SSE does.

Shareholders and debt providers
SSE must be well financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates and invest in growing the business.

Government and regulators
We rely on policy frameworks and public services that support investment in critical national infrastructure, are fair on customers and maintain the momentum behind net zero.

Suppliers, contractors and partners
We rely on a healthy supply chain and work with partners whose capabilities offer synergies for innovative project development and efficient ownership structures.
