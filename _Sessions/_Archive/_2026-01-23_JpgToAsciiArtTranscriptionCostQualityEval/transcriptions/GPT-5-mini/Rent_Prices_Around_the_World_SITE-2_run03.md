<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Shading (map-style infographic with radial labels)
- Dimensions: approximately 100x60 characters (ASCII art block above ~100 chars wide by ~60 lines tall including header/legend)
- ASCII captures:
  - Overall page title and subtitle
  - Three primary regional map clusters (North America / South America; Asia & Oceania; Europe & nearby / Africa / Middle East)
  - Each city's name and rent value (USD) as radial labels grouped by region
  - Footer attribution and app-store calls-to-action
- ASCII misses:
  - Exact circular map shapes, precise geographic outlines, and proportional radial bar lengths
  - Flag icons next to cities
  - Exact typography, font sizes, colors, and decorative headline styling
  - Many small in-map dots and gridlines used as background texture
  - Precise ordering around each radial circle (ASCII groups items as readable lists rather than exact angular positions)
- Colors (visual mapping in the original infographic):
  - Dark navy background - overall canvas
  - Blue shades - North America (high rents in US/Canada)
  - Green shades - South America
  - Pink/Magenta - Asia
  - Orange - Australia/Oceania
  - Peach/Light orange - Middle East
  - Teal/Cyan - Europe
  - Yellow - Africa
- Layout:
  - Top: Title "Rent Prices" and subtitle "AROUND THE WORLD" & descriptor line
  - Upper-right: North America map circle with radial city labels
  - Center-left: Asia map circle with radial city labels; small inset for South America at left
  - Center-bottom-left: Oceania / Australia inset near Asia cluster
  - Lower-right: Europe map circle with many radial city labels; small Africa cluster and Middle East radials nearby
  - Footer: data source, Visual Capitalist branding, "Data as of June 2025", and app store badges
- Details:
  - All numeric rent values preserved as presented in the infographic (USD, with K and plain numbers)
  - City and country/region names included; diacritics preserved where visible (e.g., "São Paulo")
  - Small explanatory note preserved: "Numbeo's rent data is crowdsourced (user-submitted)."
- Reconstruction hint:
  - To imagine the original, picture a dark navy vertical infographic with a large decorative headline at top, three large colored globe-inset maps arranged down the poster, and each map surrounded by radial bars pointing outward labeled with city names and USD monthly rents. Flags appear next to many city labels; colors indicate continent grouping.
