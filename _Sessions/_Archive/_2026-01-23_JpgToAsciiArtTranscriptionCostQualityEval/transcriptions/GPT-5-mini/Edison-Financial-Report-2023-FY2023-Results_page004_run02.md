POWER Edison – Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

-2.7% at 308.4 TWh

+19.2%    Net import
+11.2%    Other RES prod.
+35.5%    Hydro prod.
-17.4%    Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.
•  Renewables cover 30% of demand:
   ✓  Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
   ✓  Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity
•  Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports.

€ PUN at 127,2 €/MWh (FY2023 average),

  - Blue oval (main -2.7%) - indicated as (O)
  - Yellow/green/blue/gray ovals - indicated generically as (O)
- Layout: Left column infographic occupying vertical column; top flag, central main oval, four labeled ovals stacked, explanatory text block beneath, footer logos and footnote at bottom.
- Details: Exact text content preserved in ASCII; bullets and check bullets represented with • and - to show hierarchical points.
