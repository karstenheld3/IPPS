What we do

We drive progress towards net zero by developing,
building, operating and investing in clean, secure
and affordable electricity infrastructure needed
for the energy system of tomorrow.

The relationships and resources we rely on

Employees
Our strategy and success are
dependent on the shared talent,
diversity, innovation and values
of the people we employ.

Energy customers
Consumers create demand
for our energy and services.

NGOs, communities and society
We need the support of the
communities we work in and the
backing of civil society to pursue
a just transition to net zero.

Natural environment
From wind and water used to
produce energy, to materials used
to build energy infrastructure,
natural resources are essential
to what SSE does.

Shareholders and debt providers
SSE must be well financed, with the
ability to remunerate shareholders
and attract investment, source debt at
competitive rates and invest in
growing the business.

Government and regulators
We rely on policy frameworks
and public services that support
investment in critical national
infrastructure, are fair on customers
and maintain the momentum
behind net zero.

Suppliers, contractors
and partners
We rely on a healthy supply chain
and work with partners whose
capabilities offer synergies for
innovative project development
and efficient ownership structures.

- Details: Exact short descriptions for each box are preserved as text. Small icons that accompanied boxes cannot be represented in ASCII.
- Data: No numeric values in this figure other than the Key labels.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine three colored vertical columns (Renewables teal, Flexibility light teal, Networks dark blue) with four main blue boxes and several lighter boxes beneath; the index-linked earnings sentence runs above with bidirectional arrows.
