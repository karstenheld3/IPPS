- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: approx. 100x40 characters (ASCII block above ~100 cols)
- ASCII captures: The hierarchical layout of categories (Renewables, Flexibility, Networks), individual business boxes (SSE Renewables, SSE Thermal, SSEN Transmission, SSEN Distribution), the row of energy products and services (Energy Customer Solutions, SSE Enterprise, SSE Energy Markets, Corporate services), and the central narrative and SSE brand text. The left-to-right arrow phrase about index-linked earnings is represented as a header line.
- ASCII misses: Exact colors (green/aqua/dark blue), logos, icons (wind turbine, factory, transmission tower, home), rounded box styles, spacing, and exact graphic proportions.
- Colors:
  - Green/aqua (Renewables/Flexibility) - indicates market-facing businesses (M)
  - Dark blue (Networks) - indicates economically-regulated businesses (R)
- Layout: Top row shows three category headings, below are business boxes arranged left-to-right; the "Energy products and services" bar spans beneath them with four stacked service boxes; narrative block sits to the right of the service boxes with SSE logo below.
- Details: The ASCII simplifies multi-column formatting into stacked boxes and a single central narrative block. It labels market-focused vs regulated businesses with (M) and (R) inline.
- Data: All business names and short descriptions are transcribed verbatim in the ASCII boxes.
- Reconstruction hint: imagine four colored panels across the top (green, aqua, dark blue) with icons inside each box; a horizontal bar beneath labelled "Energy products and services" with four pale boxes; a large paragraph to the right of those boxes with the SSE logo and tagline beneath.

What we do

We drive progress towards net zero by developing, building, operating and investing in clean, secure and affordable electricity infrastructure needed for the energy system of tomorrow.

Develop   ->   Build
  ^                 |
  |                 v
Operate  <-   Invest

(The cycle of Develop -> Build -> Operate -> Invest continues clockwise)

The relationships and resources we rely on

Employees
Our strategy and success are
dependent on the shared talent,
diversity, innovation and values
of the people we employ.

Energy customers
Consumers create demand
for our energy and services.

NGOs, communities and society
We need the support of the
communities we work in and the
backing of civil society to pursue
a just transition to net zero.

Natural environment
From wind and water used to
produce energy, to materials used
to build energy infrastructure,
natural resources are essential
to what SSE does.

Shareholders and debt providers
SSE must be well financed, with the
ability to remunerate shareholders
for their investment, secure debt at
competitive rates and invest in
growing the business.

Government and regulators
We rely on policy frameworks
and public services that support
investment in critical national
infrastructure, are fair on customers
and maintain the momentum
behind net zero.

Suppliers, contractors
and partners
We rely on a healthy supply chain
and work with partners whose
capabilities offer synergies for
innovative project development
and efficient ownership structures.

- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: approx. 80x40 characters (ASCII block above ~80 cols)
- ASCII captures: The clockwise operational cycle (Develop -> Build -> Operate -> Invest) and the right-hand column of value metrics (c14,000 Direct employees; £12.2m Investment in communities; £2.5bn Investment in net zero infrastructure; c5m Customers served (Networks and supply); £5.5bn Supplier spend; 60p Dividend (full year); £679m/£68m Taxes paid UK/ROI; £1.8bn Market capitalisation). Also includes the relationships/resources list headings and short descriptions.

- Colors:
  - Teal - section header bars (e.g., "What we do", "The relationships and resources we rely on")
  - Dark blue - value tiles background
- Layout: The circular process is centered with arrows indicating clockwise flow. The relationships/resources are presented as two vertical columns of descriptive text; the value metrics are shown as stacked tiles on the right.
- Details: The ASCII places simple symbolic representations for each cycle node and a boxed list for metric tiles. The footnote about excluded employees is included as a line beneath the tiles.
- Data: All numeric values and labels are transcribed verbatim.
- Reconstruction hint: Picture a circular diagram with four navy icons connected by arrows, teal subheadings below it with two text columns describing stakeholders/resources, and a vertical dark-blue strip of photos with white numeric captions to the far right.
