[Notes/annotations embedded]

- Each column lists: Phase header, title, short description, then numbered steps.
```

<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: approx 123x33 characters (ASCII art block 4 columns, each ~31 chars wide; total width ~124 chars)
- ASCII captures:
  - The four vertical panels (PHASE 1 to PHASE 4) arranged left-to-right.
  - Headings for each phase, the large phase title, short description under each title.
  - All numbered steps (Step 1 through Step 12) and their short instructions, preserving line breaks and phrasing.
  - Top navigation items: "Introduction    Get ready    Onboard and engage    Deliver impact    Extend and optimize    Next steps    3    +"
  - Diagonal/ribbon small text included as "use to reference people, files and more".
  - Main page title: "Your Copilot adoption roadmap" (presented as two lines as in the image).
- ASCII misses:
  - Exact fonts, typographic weights, sizes, and precise alignment/kerning.
  - Colors (blue, light-blue, magenta, orange) are not shown; only noted in annotations.
  - Background artwork, gradients, shadows, and subtle diagonal ribbon graphics.
  - The small circular plus icon visual styling (represented as "+").
  - Any very small or partially obscured background text (faint notebook text) is omitted if illegible.
- Colors (visual mapping):
  - Leftmost panel: deep blue — represents PHASE 1 "Get ready".
  - Second panel: lighter cyan/blue — represents PHASE 2 "Onboard and engage".
  - Third panel: magenta/purple — represents PHASE 3 "Deliver impact".
  - Fourth panel: peach/orange — represents PHASE 4 "Extend and optimize".
  - Background: soft pastel gradient with diagonal ribbon (decorative).
- Layout:
  - Title in upper-left.
  - Decorative diagonal ribbon across the top with a small caption "use to reference people, files and more".
  - Top navigation bar centered near top with "Introduction" underlined followed by other nav items; page number "3" and a "+" icon on the right.
  - Four large adjacent vertical panels fill the main body, each containing a phase heading, main title, short description, and 2–3 step entries arranged roughly into two columns per panel.
- Details:
  - Preserved exact wording for each step and description as visible in the image.
  - Step text line breaks kept to reflect the visual grouping in each panel.
- Reconstruction hint:
  - To visualize the original, imagine four tall colored cards laid side-by-side, each with a bold phase title near the top, a 1–2 line description, and then three boxed step labels listed vertically. Soft abstract pastel artwork and a diagonal ribbon run behind the cards at the top of the slide.
