<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ASCII block approx 80 characters wide x ~55 lines high
- ASCII captures:
  - The layout's primary structure (three main regional map circles: North America, Asia & Oceania, Europe) and their surrounding radial bars are represented.
  - Each city label and rent price (USD) has been transcribed as a textual list next to the corresponding region in the ASCII diagram.
  - Insets (small regional maps for South America, Middle East, Australia, Africa) are noted as placeholders.
  - Header, subtitle, footer, credits, data source, and app store calls-to-action have been transcribed.
- ASCII misses:
  - Precise visual positions/angles of each radial bar, lengths proportional to values, color coding, flags, typography, decorative font styles, and graphical map detail.
  - Exact spacing and arc placement around the circles (the ASCII uses linear lists rather than radial placements).
  - Small auxiliary labels/icons (country flags, logos) are not rendered.
- Colors:
  - Teal/blue = Europe & North America groups (visual grouping not shown in ASCII)
  - Pink = Asia cluster
  - Green = South America
  - Orange/yellow = Oceania & Middle East
  - Dark background with lighter map circles and colored bars (not representable in plain ASCII)
- Layout:
  - Three dominant circular map regions arranged vertically: North-America at top-right area, Asia/Oceania center-left, Europe bottom-center in original image. ASCII places them in stacked symbolic representation with lists of cities for each.
- Details:
  - All city names and rent values included in lists were transcribed from the image. Small-state markers, exact visual ordering around each circle, and flag icons are omitted.
- Data:
  - Rent amounts transcribed as shown (e.g., "$8.4K New York", "$6.2K Singapore", "$5.6K London", etc.)
  - Footer notes transcribed: "Data as of June 2025", "Numbeo's rent data is crowdsourced (user-submitted).", "Source: Numbeo via Deutsche Bank".
- Reconstruction hint:
  - To visualize the original infographic, imagine three large dark circular world maps with colored radial bars fanning out from each circle. Each bar has a small flag icon and the city name with rent (USD). The top-right cluster focuses on North America, the central large pink/amber map focuses on Asia & Oceania, and the lower big teal circle shows Europe. Small insets for South America, Middle East, Australia, and Africa appear as smaller circles near their regions.
