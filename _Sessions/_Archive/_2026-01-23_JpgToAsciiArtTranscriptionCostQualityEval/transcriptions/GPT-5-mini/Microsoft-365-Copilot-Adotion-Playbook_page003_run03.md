<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: approximately 120x36 characters (ASCII art block width ~116, height ~30 lines)
- ASCII captures:
  - Four-column structure representing the four colored panels (Phase 1 - Phase 4).
  - Headline "Your Copilot adoption roadmap".
  - Top navigation row with sections: Introduction, Get ready, Onboard and engage, Deliver impact, Extend and optimize, Next steps, and page number 3.
  - All phase headings (PHASE 1: ... PHASE 4:), main phase titles (Get ready; Onboard and engage; Deliver impact; Extend and optimize).
  - Each listed step label and its short description (Steps 1–12 and their text).
  - Diagonal faint phrase "use to reference people, files and more" noted as a faint diagonal element.
- ASCII misses:
  - Exact typography: fonts, weights (bold), sizes, and precise spatial offsets.
  - Colors and gradients: the blue, light-blue, magenta, and orange panels and subtle background artwork are not rendered.
  - Fine graphical detail: decorative diagonal shapes, subtle drop-shadows, rounded corners, and background imagery.
  - Exact alignment and column widths are approximated; the original has precise spacing and visual hierarchy.
- Colors (visual notes):
  - Blue panel (left) - Phase 1: "Get ready"
  - Light blue panel - Phase 2: "Onboard and engage"
  - Magenta/purple panel - Phase 3: "Deliver impact"
  - Orange panel - Phase 4: "Extend and optimize"
- Layout:
  - Top area: header / page title left, navigation centered-top with an underlined active "Introduction", page number at top-right.
  - Main area: four adjacent vertical panels occupying the full width, each containing phase label, title, short subtitle, and steps arranged roughly in two columns inside each panel.
- Details:
  - Steps include short imperative phrases and many sentences end with periods; these have been preserved.
  - Step numbering is sequential across phases (1–12) as shown.
- Reconstruction hint:
  - To imagine the original, place four tall colored cards side-by-side across a pastel abstract background; each card has a small uppercase "PHASE X:" label, a large bold title, a one-line subtitle, and grouped step items (number + one-line description). The top navigation is narrow with the first item emphasized.
