**Detailed Breakdown:**

Sources (TWh):
- Thermoelectric production: Decreased from 15.7 to 14.2
- Hydroelectric production: Increased
- Wind & other renewables: Growing
- Other purchases (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.): Varied

Uses (TWh):
- End customers: Slight changes
- Other sales (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.): Shifted
- Edison Next: Minimal variation

Key Metrics:
- Total Power Demand: -2.7%
- Renewables Coverage: 30% of demand
- Hydro Production: Improved due to stronger rainfall
- PV and Wind: Increased installed capacity
- PUN (Unique National Price): €127.2/MWh (FY2023 average), -58.1% vs FY2022
