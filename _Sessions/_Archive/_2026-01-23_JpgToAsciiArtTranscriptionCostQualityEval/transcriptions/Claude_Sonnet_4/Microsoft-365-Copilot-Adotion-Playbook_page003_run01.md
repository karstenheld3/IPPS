- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: 80x30 characters
- ASCII captures: Four-phase structure, step numbers, phase titles, step descriptions
- ASCII misses: Color coding (blue, light blue, purple, orange gradient), decorative background graphics, geometric shapes, plus icon
- Colors:
  - Phase 1: Blue background - foundational preparation phase
  - Phase 2: Light blue background - engagement and acceleration phase  
  - Phase 3: Purple background - measurement and results phase
  - Phase 4: Orange background - optimization and expansion phase
- Layout: Four equal-width columns representing sequential phases, with steps listed vertically within each phase
- Details: Decorative geometric patterns in background, gradient color transitions between phases, clean modern design aesthetic
- Data: 12 total implementation steps distributed across 4 phases (4-2-3-3 distribution)
- Reconstruction hint: Professional Microsoft-style infographic with vibrant color coding to distinguish implementation phases
