WHAT WE DO
==========
                    [DEVELOP]

                        |
                   [OPERATE]

The relationships and resources we rely on:

EMPLOYEES: Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.

ENERGY CUSTOMERS: Consumers create demand for our services and products.

SHAREHOLDERS AND DEBT PROVIDERS: SSE must be well financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates and invest in growing the business.

GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORS: Policy on climate frameworks and public services that support investment in critical national infrastructure, are fair on customers and maintain the momentum for investment.

NGOS, COMMUNITIES AND SOCIETY: We need the support of the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT: From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to create infrastructure and natural resources essential to what SSE does.

SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS AND PARTNERS: We rely on a healthy supply chain and work with partners whose capabilities offer synergies for innovative project development and efficient ownership structures.
