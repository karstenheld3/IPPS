HOW WE ARE STRUCTURED:
                Index-linked earnings from economically-regulated
                networks offset inherent risk in market-facing businesses

SSE has a very deliberate mix of market-based and economically-regulated businesses that span the clean energy value chain. The Group's synergies and natural hedges, along with our world-class assets and balance sheet strength, enable us to create lasting value in a highly competitive operating environment.

**THE RELATIONSHIPS AND RESOURCES WE RELY ON**

**Employees**
Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.

**Energy customers**  
Consumers create demand for our products and services.

**NGOs, communities and society**
We need the support of the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.

**Natural environment**
From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to construct our assets, our natural resources are essential to what SSE does.

**Shareholders and debt providers**
SSE must be well financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates and invest in growth opportunities.

**Government and regulators**
Policy on policy frameworks and public services that support investment in critical national infrastructure, are fair on customers and maintain the momentum towards net zero.

**Suppliers, contractors and partners**
We rely on a healthy supply chain and work with partners whose capabilities offer synergies for innovative project development and efficient ownership structures.
