**Employees**
Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.

**Energy customers**
Consumers create demand for our energy and services.

**NGOs, communities and society**
We need the support of the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.

**Natural environment**
From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to build energy infrastructure, natural resources are essential to what SSE does.

**Shareholders and debt providers**
SSE must be well financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates and invest in growing the business.

**Government and regulators**
We rely on policy frameworks and public service that support investment in critical national infrastructure, our customers and maintain the momentum behind net zero.

**Suppliers, contractors and partners**
We rely on a healthy supply chain capable of delivering the best innovative projects on time and efficient ownership structures.
