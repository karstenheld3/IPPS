**The value we create**

- c14,000 Direct employees
- £12.2m Investment in communities
- £2.5bn Investment in net zero infrastructure
- c5m Customers served (Networks and Supply)

**The relationships and resources we rely on**

- **Employees**: Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.
- **Energy customers**: Consumers create demand for our energy and services.
- **NGOs, communities and society**: We need their support in the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.
- **Natural environment**: From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to build energy infrastructure, natural resources are essential to what SSE does.

**Financial Insights**

- **Shareholders and debt providers**: SSE must be well-financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates, and invest in growing the business.
- **Government and regulators**: We rely on policy frameworks and public service transport investment in critical national infrastructure.
- **Suppliers, contractors and partners**: We rely on a healthy supply chain with robust procurement capabilities.

- **£5.5bn** Supplier spend
- **60p** Dividend (full year)
- **£679m/€68m** Taxes paid (UK/ROI)
- **£18bn** Market capitalisation
