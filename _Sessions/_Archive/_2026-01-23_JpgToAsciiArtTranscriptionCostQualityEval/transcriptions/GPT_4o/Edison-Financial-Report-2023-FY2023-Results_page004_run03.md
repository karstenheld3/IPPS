# POWER Edison – Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

-2.7% at 308.4 TWh

+19.2% Net import
+11.2% Other RES prod.
+35.5% Hydro prod.
-17.4% Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.
- Renewables cover 30% of demand:
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity
- Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports.
  
€ PUN at 127,2 €/MWh (FY2023 average), -58.1% vs FY2022
