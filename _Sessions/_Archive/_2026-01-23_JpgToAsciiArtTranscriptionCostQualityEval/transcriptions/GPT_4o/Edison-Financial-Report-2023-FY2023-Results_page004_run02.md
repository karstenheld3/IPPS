-2.7% at 308.4 TWh

+19.2% Net import

+11.2% Other RES prod.

+35.5% Hydro prod.

-17.4% Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.

- Renewables cover 30% of demand:
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity

- Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due to higher imports.
