**Key Statistics:**
- **-2.7%** at 308.4 TWh (Italian power demand satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%)
- **+19.2%** Net import
- **+11.2%** Other RES prod.
- **+35.5%** Hydro prod.
- **-17.4%** Thermo prod.

**ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%)** satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.
- Renewables cover 30% of demand:
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity
- Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports

**PUN at 127.2 €/MWh** (FY2023 average), **-58.1% vs FY2022**
