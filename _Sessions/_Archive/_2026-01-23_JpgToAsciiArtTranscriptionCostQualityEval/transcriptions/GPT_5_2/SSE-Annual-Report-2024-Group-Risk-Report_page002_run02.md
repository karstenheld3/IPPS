<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~115x70 characters
- ASCII captures: Three-column page layout; main headings; the four core business blocks; the “Develop/Build/Operate/Invest” cycle; the relationships/resources list; the value tiles with metrics; key/legend; footer items.
- ASCII misses: Exact typography, spacing, and the photographic content (people/industrial scenes) within the value tiles; precise icon artwork details.
- Colors:
  - Dark blue - headings, networks blocks, and right-hand value column background
  - Teal/aqua - section header bands and some business blocks (renewables/flexibility style)
  - Light grey - background panels and corporate services bar
- Layout: Top header with title and subtitle; below it a three-panel grid: left “How we are structured”, middle “What we do”, right “The value we create”. Left panel has blocks and a key; middle has paragraph, cycle diagram, and a relationships/resources list; right has a vertical stack of photo+metric tiles and a footnote.
- Details: Icons in business blocks (wind/hydro/plant/pylon/pole/house/people/chart) are represented as bracketed notes; arrows and circular flow simplified.
- Data: Preserves all visible numbers and labels (c14,000*, £12.2m, £2.5bn, c5m, £5.5bn, 60p, £679m/£68m, £18bn; footnote about 1,089 employees; “Group Risk Report 2024”; page numbers 1 and 2).
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine a corporate report infographic with teal section headers, dark-blue metric tiles with photos, and four colored business-unit cards under “How we are structured.”
