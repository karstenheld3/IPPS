- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~110x55 characters
- ASCII captures: Main title/subtitle; concept of multiple regional globes; radial spokes with city labels and rent values; footer/source text blocks and app badges.
- ASCII misses: Exact geography/coastlines; precise spoke angles/lengths; country/city flag icons; exact colors and gradients; small dot markers on maps.
- Colors:
  - Dark navy background - page backdrop
  - Blue - North America region/spokes
  - Green - Latin America region/spokes
  - Pink - Asia region/spokes
  - Orange - Oceania region/spokes
  - Cyan/teal - Europe region/spokes
  - Yellow - Africa region/spokes
- Layout: Large headline at top; three main large globes (North America upper right, Asia center, Europe bottom center); smaller inset globes for South America, Middle East, Oceania, Africa; city/rent labels arranged as radial “fans” around each region.
- Details: Each city label is paired with a small flag icon in the original; globes include small circular markers for cities.
- Data: Rents shown in USD (K = thousands) for 3-bedroom apartments in city center; “Data as of June 2025”; “Source: Numbeo via Deutsche Bank”; “Numbeo's rent data is crowdsourced (user-submitted).”
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine a dark poster-style infographic with colorful continent silhouettes inside circular globes, with rent “spokes” radiating outward like sunbeams to labeled cities.
