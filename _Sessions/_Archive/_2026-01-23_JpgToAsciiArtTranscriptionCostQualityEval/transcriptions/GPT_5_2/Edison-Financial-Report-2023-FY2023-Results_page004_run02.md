ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.  
- Renewables cover 30% of demand:  
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall  
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity  
- Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports.

<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~118x34 characters
- ASCII captures: Two sections (SOURCES vs USES), each with FY2023 and FY2022 stacked bars; segment values inside stacks; totals above; divider between SOURCES and USES; legends for color-coded categories; percentage change annotations between yearly bars.
- ASCII misses: Exact colors (dark blue, light blue, green, orange, gray; and lime/orange/gray on USES), precise bar heights/scale, small logo graphic details, typography (italics) of headings.
- Colors:
  - SOURCES: dark blue = Thermoelectric production; light blue = Hydroelectric production; green = Wind & other renewables production; orange = Other purchases (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.) (1); gray = Edison Next
  - USES: lime = Other sales (wholesalers, IPEX, etc.); orange = End customers (1); gray = Edison Next
- Layout: Left callout panel with Italy flag and oval callouts; central-left SOURCES stacked bars; central-right USES stacked bars; vertical divider line between SOURCES and USES; page footer with logo, note, confidentiality line, and page number.
- Details: Percent changes shown as small text between the bars in each section; units “(TWh)” at top right near a lightning icon.
- Data: SOURCES FY2023 segments 14,2; 2,3; 2,2; 17,6; 0,77 total 37,1. SOURCES FY2022 segments 15,7; 1,4; 1,9; 18,0; 0,69 total 37,7. USES FY2023 segments 13,7; 22,6; 0,77 total 37,1. USES FY2022 segments 14,2; 22,8; 0,69 total 37,7. Other text includes: “€ PUN at 127,2 €/MWh (FY2023 average), -58.1% vs FY2022”; “(1) Before line losses”; “C1 Confidential”; “4”.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine a corporate slide with a large title, a left explanatory box with an Italy flag and five oval % callouts, and two clean stacked-column charts labeled SOURCES and USES.
