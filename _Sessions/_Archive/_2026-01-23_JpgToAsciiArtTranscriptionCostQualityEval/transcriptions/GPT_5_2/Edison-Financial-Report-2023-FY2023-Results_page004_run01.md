# POWER Edison - Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

(TWh)

## [Left panel - Italy callouts]

-2.7% at  
308.4 TWh

+19.2%  
Net import

+11.2%  
Other RES prod.

+35.5%  
Hydro prod.

-17.4%  
Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.  
• Renewables cover 30% of demand:  
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall  
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity  
• Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports

PUN at 127,2 €/MWh (FY2023 average),  
-58.1% vs FY2022

- Dimensions: ~70x28 characters
- ASCII captures: Italy flag presence, oval callouts with % values and labels, main bullet text, PUN line.
- ASCII misses: Exact oval shapes, precise typography, and color styling of callouts (blue/yellow/green outlines).
- Colors:
  - Blue oval: “-2.7% at 308.4 TWh”
  - Yellow/green/blue/gray outlines: the four change callouts
- Layout: Flag at top; central large callout; four stacked change callouts; paragraph and bullets below; PUN line near bottom.
- Details: Checkmark symbols are represented as hyphen bullets in ASCII.
- Data: All numeric values reproduced as shown (including comma in 127,2 and decimals).
- Reconstruction hint: The callouts are horizontally centered ovals aligned vertically; the explanatory text block sits left-aligned beneath them.
