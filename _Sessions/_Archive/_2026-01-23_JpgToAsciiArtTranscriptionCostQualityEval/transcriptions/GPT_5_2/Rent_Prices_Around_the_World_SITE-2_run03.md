- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: ~110x65 characters
- ASCII captures: Overall infographic structure; title/subtitle; four regional globes/insets; radial “spokes” listing cities and rent values; footer notes and source.
- ASCII misses: Precise geography outlines, exact angles/lengths of every spoke, small country/city dots, and flag icons next to each city.
- Colors:
  - Dark navy background - page background
  - Blue - North America region + spokes
  - Green - Latin America region + spokes
  - Pink - Asia region + spokes
  - Orange - Oceania region + spokes
  - Teal - Europe region + spokes
  - Yellow - Africa region + spokes
- Layout: Large title at top; North America globe upper center with right-side spokes; Asia globe mid-page with many spokes around; Europe globe lower center with right-side spokes; small inset circles for South America, Middle East, Oceania, Africa; footer at bottom with logos and source.
- Details: City labels include small flag icons; rent values use K abbreviations (e.g., $8.4K) except some exact dollars (e.g., $852, $815, $412).
- Data: All visible city/value labels transcribed as shown, including punctuation/casing (e.g., "Tel Aviv-Yafo").
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine a dark-themed infographic with circular regional maps; each city appears on a colored radial bar with a flag, city name, and rent.
