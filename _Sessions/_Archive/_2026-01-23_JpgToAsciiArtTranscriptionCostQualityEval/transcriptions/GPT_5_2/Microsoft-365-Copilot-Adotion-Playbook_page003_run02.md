- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: 118x31 characters
- ASCII captures: Four side-by-side phase panels; phase titles, subtitles, and all steps 1–12 with their text; top navigation labels and page number.
- ASCII misses: Exact typography, background imagery, and color gradients on each phase panel.
- Colors:
  - Blue panel(s) - PHASE 1 and PHASE 2 backgrounds
  - Purple panel - PHASE 3 background
  - Orange panel - PHASE 4 background
- Layout: Left-aligned page title; a top navigation row across the upper area; below it, a four-column grid with equal-width panels from PHASE 1 to PHASE 4.
- Details: Panels use large bold headings (“Get ready”, “Onboard and engage”, etc.) with smaller descriptive subtitles and two-column step lists within each panel.
- Data: Steps 1–12 and their exact wording as transcribed.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine a clean Microsoft-style slide with four colored vertical cards (blue, blue, purple, orange) containing the phase headings and step bullets.
