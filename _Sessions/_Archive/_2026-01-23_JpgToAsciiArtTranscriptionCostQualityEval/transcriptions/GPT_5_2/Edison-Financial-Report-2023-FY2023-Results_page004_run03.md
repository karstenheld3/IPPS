# POWER Edison - Decrease in thermal production and significant increase in renewable generation

(TWh)

## [Left panel - Italy summary]

-2.7% at  
308.4 TWh

+19.2%  
Net import

+11.2%  
Other RES prod.

+35.5%  
Hydro prod.

-17.4%  
Thermo prod.

ITALIAN POWER DEMAND (-2.7%) satisfied by thermo generation for 51.7%.  
• Renewables cover 30% of demand:  
  ✓ Improved hydro production thanks to stronger rainfall  
  ✓ Growth in PV and wind generation supported by growth in installed capacity  
• Lower thermo production (-17.4%) due by higher imports.

PUN at 127,2 €/MWh (FY2023 average),  
-58.1% vs FY2022

- Dimensions: 74x26 characters
- ASCII captures: Flag block, KPI ovals as labeled items, bullet list text, PUN statement, boxed panel layout.
- ASCII misses: Exact colors of ovals and flag, typography/weights, subtle alignment/spacing.
- Colors:
  - Green/white/red - Italian flag
  - Blue oval - “-2.7% at 308.4 TWh”
  - Yellow/green/light blue/dark blue ovals - the four KPI lines
  - Red text - “-58.1% vs FY2022”

- Details: CheckS (checkmarks) shown as “-” in ASCII bullets (original uses checkmarks).
- Data: -2.7%, 308.4 TWh, +19.2%, +11.2%, +35.5%, -17.4%, 51.7%, 30%, 127,2 €/MWh, -58.1% vs FY2022.
- Reconstruction hint: Think of a clean corporate slide with colored ovals aligned left and a small Italy flag above them.
