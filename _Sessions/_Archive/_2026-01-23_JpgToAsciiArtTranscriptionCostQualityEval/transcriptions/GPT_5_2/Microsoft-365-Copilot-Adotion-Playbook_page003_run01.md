<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: 107x33 characters
- ASCII captures: Four phase panels, headings, subtitles, and all step numbers with their text; left-to-right roadmap layout.
- ASCII misses: Exact typography (font weights/sizes), background photographic/gradient imagery, and precise color gradients.
- Colors:
  - Deep blue panel (Phase 1)
  - Light blue/cyan panel (Phase 2)
  - Purple/magenta panel (Phase 3)
  - Peach/orange panel (Phase 4)
- Layout: Single row of four equal-width vertical panels, arranged left to right; each panel contains phase label, title, subtitle, then steps in smaller text (some steps arranged in two columns in the original).
- Details: Original includes a top navigation-like row (“Introduction … Next steps”) and page number “3”; subtle background image/diagonal shapes behind the panels.
- Data: Steps 1–12 and their descriptions as transcribed in the ASCII.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine a slide with four tall colored blocks; each block has a bold title and a short subtitle, with step callouts below.
