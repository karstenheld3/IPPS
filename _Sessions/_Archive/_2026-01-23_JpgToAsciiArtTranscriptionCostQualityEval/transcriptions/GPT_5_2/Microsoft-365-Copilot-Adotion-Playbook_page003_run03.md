<transcription_notes>
- Mode: Structural
- Dimensions: 108x33 characters
- ASCII captures: Four-phase column layout; phase titles; subtitles; steps 1–12 with their exact wording; top navigation items and page number; left-side page title.
- ASCII misses: Background photographic/gradient shapes; exact typography; precise spacing/margins; color blocks (blue/teal/purple/orange); small circular “+” icon at top right; partial, blurred photo at far right edge.
- Colors:
  - Blue (Phase 1 column) - "Get ready"
  - Light blue/teal (Phase 2 column) - "Onboard and engage"
  - Purple (Phase 3 column) - "Deliver impact"
  - Orange (Phase 4 column) - "Extend and optimize"
- Layout: Left side contains the main title; center/lower area is a 4-column roadmap panel; top has a horizontal navigation list and page number “3”.
- Details: Background includes angled bands and a faint diagonal text band; right edge shows a small, partially visible image of people; top-right has a circular plus sign icon.
- Data: Steps listed exactly as shown (Step 1–12) and phase subtitles.
- Reconstruction hint: Imagine a modern slide with four vertical colored panels aligned side-by-side under the page title, each panel listing steps for that phase.
