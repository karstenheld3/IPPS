## The relationships and resources we rely on

Employees  
Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.

Energy customers  
Consumers create demand for our energy and services.

NGOs, communities and society  
We need the support of the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.

Natural environment  
From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to build energy infrastructure, natural resources are essential to what SSE does.

Shareholders and debt providers  
SSE must be well financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates and invest in growing the business.

Government and regulators  
We rely on policy frameworks and public services that support investment in critical national infrastructure, are fair on customers and maintain the momentum behind net zero.

Suppliers, contractors and partners  
We rely on a healthy supply chain and workforce partners whose capabilities offer synergies for innovative project development and efficient ownership structures.
