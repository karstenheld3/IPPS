# How we create value

## Our business model

We are developing, building, operating and investing in our unique portfolio of assets across the electricity value chain.

## How we are structured

Index-linked earnings from economically-regulated networks offset inherent risk in market-facing businesses

SSE has a very deliberate mix of market-based and economically-regulated businesses that span the clean energy value chain. The Group’s synergies and natural hedges, along with our world-class assets and balance sheet strength, enable us to create lasting value in a highly complex operating environment.

SSE  
For a better world of energy

## What we do

We drive progress towards net zero by developing, building, operating and investing in clean, secure and affordable electricity infrastructure needed for the energy system of tomorrow.

## The relationships and resources we rely on

Employees  
Our strategy and success are dependent on the shared talent, diversity, innovation and values of the people we employ.

Energy customers  
Consumers create demand for our energy and services.

NGOs, communities and society  
We need the support of the communities we work in and the backing of civil society to pursue a just transition to net zero.

Natural environment  
From wind and water used to produce energy, to materials used to build energy infrastructure, natural resources are essential to what SSE does.

Shareholders and debt providers  
SSE must be well financed, with the ability to remunerate shareholders for their investment, secure debt at competitive rates and invest in growing the business.

Government and regulators  
We rely on policy frameworks and public services that support investment in critical national infrastructure, are fair on customers and maintain the fair momentum behind net zero.

Suppliers, contractors and partners  
We rely on a healthy supply chain and work with partners whose capabilities offer synergies for innovative project development and efficient ownership structures.
