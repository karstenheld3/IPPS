<transcription_notes>
- Data: Totals and slice values are taken directly from the chart labels: 2019 total 12,681; 2020 total 12,328; 2021 total 12,062.
- Colors (approximate / by legend): 
  - red = Africa (excluding North Africa)
  - dark red/orange = Americas
  - coral = Asia‑Pacific
  - pink = Europe
  - peach = Middle East and North Africa
- ASCII misses: donut shapes and slice ordering (clockwise) cannot be shown precisely in ASCII; mapping of slice positions to colors is based on the legend and slice labels.
