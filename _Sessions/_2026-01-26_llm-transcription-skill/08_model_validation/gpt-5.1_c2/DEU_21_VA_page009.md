## Footnotes

(1) Based on SEC rules (Brent at $69.23/b in 2021, $41.32/b in 2020 and $62.74/b in 2019).

(2) Capacity data based on crude distillation unit stream-day capacities under normal operating conditions, less the average impact of shutdowns for regular repair and maintenance activities.

(3) Includes refineries in Africa that are reported in the Marketing & Services segment.

(4) Including 50% of the joint-venture between TotalEnergies and Borealis.

(5) Including interests in Qatar, 50% of the capacities of Hanwha Total Petrochemicals Co. Limited and 37.5% of SATORP in Saudi Arabia.

(6) Olefins.

(7) Excluding trading and bulk refining sales.

(8) Including Turkey.

(9) Including Indian Ocean islands.
