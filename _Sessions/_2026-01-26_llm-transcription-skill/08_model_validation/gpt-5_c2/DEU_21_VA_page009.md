## Notes

(1) Based on SEC rules (Brent at $69.23/b in 2021, $41.32/b in 2020 and $62.74/b in 2019).  
(2) Capacity data based on crude distillation unit stream-day capacities under normal operating conditions, less the average impact of shutdowns for regular repair and maintenance activities.  
(3) Includes refineries in Africa that are reported in the Marketing & Services segment.  
(4) Including 50% of the joint-venture between TotalEnergies and Borealis.  
(5) Including interests in Qatar, 50% of the capacities of Hanwha Total Petrochemicals Co. Limited and 37.5% of SATORP in Saudi Arabia.  
(6) Olefins.  
(7) Excluding trading and bulk refining sales.  
(8) Including Turkey.  
(9) Including Indian Ocean islands.
