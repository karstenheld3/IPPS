2) Capacity data based on crude distillation unit stream-day capacities under normal operating conditions, less the average impact of shutdowns for regular repair and maintenance activities.

3) Includes refineries in Africa that are reported in the Marketing & Services segment.

4) Including 50% of the joint-venture between TotalEnergies and Borealis.

5) Including interests in Qatar, 50% of the capacities of Hanwha Total Petrochemicals Co. Limited and 37.5% of SATORP in Saudi Arabia.

6) Olefins.

7) Excluding trading and bulk refining sales.
