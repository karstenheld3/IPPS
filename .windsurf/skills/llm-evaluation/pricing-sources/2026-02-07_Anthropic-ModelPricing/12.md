# Frequently asked questions

### How is token usage calculated?

Tokens are pieces of text that models process. As a rough estimate, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words in English. The exact count varies by language and content type.

### Are there free tiers or trials?

New users receive a small amount of free credits to test the API. Contact sales for information about extended trials for enterprise evaluation.

### How do discounts stack?

Batch API and prompt caching discounts can be combined. For example, using both features together provides significant cost savings compared to standard API calls.

### What payment methods are accepted?

We accept major credit cards for standard accounts. Enterprise customers can arrange invoicing and other payment methods.

For additional questions about pricing, contact support@anthropic.com.
