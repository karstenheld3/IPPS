<transcription_page_header> Calculate input tokens | Tool use pricing </transcription_page_header>

<!-- Section 1 -->
Calculate the total input tokens by summing:

- `input_tokens`
- `cache_creation_input_tokens` (if using prompt caching)
- `cache_read_input_tokens` (if using prompt caching)

If the total exceeds 200,000 tokens, the entire request was billed at 1M context rates.

For more information about the `usage` object, see the API response documentation.

## Tool use pricing

Tool use requests are priced based on:

1. The total number of input tokens sent to the model (including in the `tools` parameter)
2. The number of output tokens generated
3. For server-side tools, additional usage-based pricing (e.g., web search charges per search performed)

Client-side tools are priced the same as any other Claude API request, while server-side tools may incur additional charges based on their specific usage.

The additional tokens from tool use come from:

- The `tools` parameter in API requests (tool names, descriptions, and schemas)
- `tool_use` content blocks in API requests and responses
- `tool_result` content blocks in API requests

When you use `tools`, we also automatically include a special system prompt for the model which enables tool use. The number of tool use tokens required for each model are listed below (excluding the additional tokens listed above). Note that the table assumes at least 1 tool is provided. If no `tools` are provided, then a tool choice of `none` uses 0 additional system prompt tokens.

- Visual: A table header with three columns is visible: "Model", "Tool choice", "Tool use system prompt token count".
- Only the top of the table is visible; subsequent rows are cut off by the image bottom edge.
- Colors/formatting: standard documentation table style (header bold). Right-side floating UI ("Ask Docs") is decorative and omitted.
- Source context: Documentation page about token billing and tool use pricing.
