**Figure 1: Prompt caching pricing notes (info box visible above the "Third-party platform pricing" heading)**

```ascii
[INFO BOX]
ℹ️ MTok = Million tokens. The "Base Input Tokens" column shows standard input pricing,
"Cache Writes" and "Cache Hits" are specific to prompt caching, and "Output Tokens"
shows output pricing. Prompt caching offers both 5-minute (default) and 1-hour cache
durations to optimize costs for different use cases.

The table above reflects the following pricing multipliers for prompt caching:

• 5-minute cache write tokens are 1.25 times the base input tokens price
• 1-hour cache write tokens are 2 times the base input tokens price
• Cache read tokens are 0.1 times the base input tokens price
```

**Figure 2: Regional endpoint pricing for Claude 4.5 models and beyond (blue info box below the third-party links)**

```ascii
[INFO BOX]
ℹ️ Regional endpoint pricing for Claude 4.5 models and beyond

Starting with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5, AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI offer
two endpoint types:

• Global endpoints: Dynamic routing across regions for maximum availability
• Regional endpoints: Data routing guaranteed within specific geographic regions

Regional endpoints include a 10% premium over global endpoints. The Claude API (1P)
is global by default and unaffected by this change. The Claude API is global-only
(equivalent to the global endpoint offering and pricing from other providers).

Scope: This pricing structure applies to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and all future
models. Earlier models (Claude Sonnet 4, Opus 4, and prior releases) retain their
existing pricing.
