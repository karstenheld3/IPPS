## Specific tool pricing

### Bash tool

The bash tool adds 245 input tokens to your API calls.

Additional tokens are consumed by:

- Command outputs (stdout/stderr)
- Error messages
- Large file contents

See tool use pricing for complete pricing details.

### Code execution tool

Code execution tool usage is tracked separately from token usage. Execution time has a minimum of 5 minutes. If files are included in the request, execution time is billed even if the tool is not used due to files being preloaded onto the container.

Each organization receives 1,550 free hours of usage with the code execution tool per month. Additional usage beyond the first 1,550 hours is billed at $0.05 per hour, per container.

### Text editor tool

The text editor tool uses the same pricing structure as other tools used with Claude. It follows the standard input and output token pricing based on the Claude model you're using.

In addition to the base tokens, the following additional input tokens are needed for the text editor tool:
