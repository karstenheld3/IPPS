# Long context pricing

When using Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, or Sonnet 4 with the 1M token context window enabled, requests that exceed 200K input tokens are automatically charged at premium long context rates:

**Table 1: Long context pricing by model**

| Model | ≤ 200K input tokens | > 200K input tokens |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Claude Opus 4.6 | Input: $5 / MTok<br>Output: $25 / MTok | Input: $10 / MTok<br>Output: $37.50 / MTok |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 / 4 | Input: $3 / MTok<br>Output: $15 / MTok | Input: $6 / MTok<br>Output: $22.50 / MTok |

- Table shows separate input and output rates per model and per input-token threshold.
- Unit: dollars per MTok (million tokens).
- Visual: table with subtle row separators and plain text pricing; no additional icons.

Long context pricing stacks with other pricing modifiers:

- The Batch API 50% discount applies to long context pricing
- Prompt caching multipliers apply on top of long context pricing
- The data residency 1.1x multiplier applies on top of long context pricing

**Figure 2: Pricing clarification info box**

```ascii
[INFO BOX - PRICING CLARIFICATION]
i  Even with the beta flag enabled, requests with fewer than 200K input tokens are charged
   at standard rates. If your request exceeds 200K input tokens, all tokens incur premium
   pricing.

   The 200K threshold is based solely on input tokens (including cache reads/writes).
   Output token count does not affect pricing tier selection, though output tokens are charged
   at the higher rate when the input threshold is exceeded.

To check if your API request was charged at the 1M context window rates, examine the usage object in the API response:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": [unclear: 250000?],
    "output_tokens": [unclear],
    "total_tokens": [unclear]
  }
}
```
