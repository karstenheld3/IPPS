<transcription_notes>
- Table layout: two-column table with "TOOL" left and "COST" right.
- The "Code Interpreter" cost cell contains four tiered rows (1 GB, 4 GB, 16 GB, 64 GB) with per-container prices.
- "File search storage" unit is "$0.10 / GB per day" with "1GB free" noted.
- "File search tool call" is specified as "Responses API only".
- Web search entries include both tool-call pricing (per 1k calls) and notes that search content tokens are billed at model rates or are free for specific preview types.
- Visual: thin horizontal separators between table rows; right column aligned with pricing details. No color-critical data present.

The tokens used for built-in tools are billed at the chosen model's per-token rates. GB refers to binary gigabytes of storage (also known as gibibyte), where 1GB is 2^30 bytes.

Web search: There are two components that contribute to the cost of using the web search tool: (1) tool calls and (2) search content tokens. Tool calls are billed per 1000 calls, according to the tool version and model type. The billing dashboard and invoices will report these line items as "web search tool calls."

Search content tokens are tokens retrieved from the search index and fed to the model alongside your prompt to generate an answer. These are billed at the model's input token rate, unless otherwise specified.

[1] For `gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-4.1-mini` with the web search non-preview tool, search content tokens are charged as a fixed block of 8,000 input tokens per call.
