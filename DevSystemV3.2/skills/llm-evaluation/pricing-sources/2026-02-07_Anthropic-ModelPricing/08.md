# Web search tool

Web search usage is charged in addition to token usage:

"usage": {
  "input_tokens": 105,
  "output_tokens": 6039,
  "cache_read_input_tokens": 7123,
  "cache_creation_input_tokens": 7345,
  "server_tool_use": {
    "web_search_requests": 1
  }
}
```

Web search is available on the Claude API for $10 per 1,000 searches, plus standard token costs for search-generated content. Web search results retrieved throughout a conversation are counted as input tokens, in search iterations executed during a single turn and in subsequent conversation turns.

Each web search counts as one use, regardless of the number of results returned. If an error occurs during web search, the web search will not be billed.

<!-- Section 2 -->
## Web fetch tool

Web fetch usage has no additional charges beyond standard token costs:

<transcription_image>
**Figure 2: Web fetch usage example (JSON usage object)**

```ascii
"usage": {
  "input_tokens": 25039,
  "output_tokens": 931,
  "cache_read_input_tokens": 0,
  "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0,
  "server_tool_use": {
    "web_fetch_requests": 1
  }
}
```

<transcription_json>
{"chart_type":"code_snippet","title":"Web fetch usage example","data":{"usage":{"input_tokens":25039,"output_tokens":931,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"server_tool_use":{"web_fetch_requests":1}}},"format":"JSON"}
</transcription_json>

<transcription_notes>
- Visual: Rounded rectangular light-grey code box with monospace text (same styling as Figure 1).
- Colors: keys in teal/green, numbers in black/dark.
- Context: Example JSON showing usage values for a single web fetch request.
- Notable values: input_tokens = 25039, output_tokens = 931.

The web fetch tool is available on the Claude API at no additional cost. You only pay standard token costs for the fetched content that becomes part of your conversation context.

To protect against inadvertently fetching large content that would consume excessive tokens, use the `max_content_tokens` parameter to set appropriate limits based on your use case and budget considerations.
