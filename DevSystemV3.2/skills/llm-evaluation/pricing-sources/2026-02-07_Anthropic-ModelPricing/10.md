## Cost optimization strategies

When building agents with Claude.

1. **Use appropriate models:** Choose Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for complex reasoning  
2. **Implement prompt caching:** Reduce costs for repeated context  
3. **Batch operations:** Use the Batch API for non-time-sensitive tasks  
4. **Monitor usage patterns:** Track token consumption to identify optimization opportunities
