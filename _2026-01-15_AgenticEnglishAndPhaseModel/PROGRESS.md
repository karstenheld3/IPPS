## Done

- Defined Agentic English syntax (instruction tokens vs context states)
- Created `_SPEC_AGEN_AGENTIC_ENGLISH.md [AGEN-SP01]` with verbs, placeholders, labels, context states
- Created `_SPEC_EDIRD_PHASE_MODEL.md [EDIRD-SP01]` with 5-phase model (EXPLORE, DESIGN, IMPLEMENT, REFINE, DELIVER)
- Renamed phases: DISCOVERY → EXPLORE, IMPROVE → REFINE
- Added `[TEST]` verb to REFINE phase for regression testing
- Ran Devil's Advocate and Pragmatic Programmer reviews
- Updated `devsystem-ids.md` to allow 2-6 char topic IDs
- Updated `review-devilsadvocate.md` with MUST-RESEARCH phase (5 topics + industry research)
- Committed and pushed 4 commits to GitHub
- Clarified BUILD vs SOLVE distinction (code-centric vs universal problem-solving)
- Added new verbs to AGEN-SP01: [EVALUATE], [SYNTHESIZE], [CONCLUDE], [RECOMMEND]
- Updated [PROPOSE] description (present multiple options for choice)
- Created `_SPEC_EDIRD_VARIATION_A_UNIFIED.md [EDIRD-SP02]` - single adaptive model
- Created `_SPEC_EDIRD_VARIATION_B_DUAL.md [EDIRD-SP03]` - two domain-optimized models
- Created `_INFO_EDIRD_VARIATION_COMPARISON.md [EDIRD-IN01]` - comparison analysis
- Decided: Unified model (A) with best ideas from Dual model (B)
- Extended AGEN-SP01 with 13 new verbs for SOLVE workflows
- Created `_SPEC_EDIRD_PHASE_MODEL_2.md [EDIRD-SP04]` - consolidated v2 spec with:
  - Unified BUILD/SOLVE workflow types
  - Comprehensive gate checklists for each phase transition
  - Next Action Logic for deterministic autonomous agent operation
  - Verb outcome transition handlers
  - Workflow flows for BUILD (HIGH/LOW) and SOLVE (EVALUATION/WRITING)
