# Session Progress

## To Do

- Begin implementation: IS-01, IS-02 (Setup)

## In Progress

## Done

- Reviewed IMPL plan against AGEN-SP01, EDIRD-SP04 specs (created `_IMPL_DEVSYSTEM_V3_MIGRATION_REVIEW.md [DSVS-RV02]`)
- Fixed RV02-01: Added PROGRESS.md phase plan template to IS-04
- Fixed RV02-02: Clarified session-management skill phase tracking templates
- Defined Agentic English syntax (instruction tokens vs context states)
- Created `_SPEC_AGEN_AGENTIC_ENGLISH.md [AGEN-SP01]` with verbs, placeholders, labels, context states
- Created `_SPEC_EDIRD_PHASE_MODEL.md [EDIRD-SP01]` with 5-phase model (EXPLORE, DESIGN, IMPLEMENT, REFINE, DELIVER)
- Renamed phases: DISCOVERY → EXPLORE, IMPROVE → REFINE
- Added `[TEST]` verb to REFINE phase for regression testing
- Ran Devil's Advocate and Pragmatic Programmer reviews
- Updated `devsystem-ids.md` to allow 2-6 char topic IDs
- Updated `review-devilsadvocate.md` with MUST-RESEARCH phase (5 topics + industry research)
- Committed and pushed 4 commits to GitHub
- Clarified BUILD vs SOLVE distinction (code-centric vs universal problem-solving)
- Added new verbs to AGEN-SP01: [EVALUATE], [SYNTHESIZE], [CONCLUDE], [RECOMMEND]
- Updated [PROPOSE] description (present multiple options for choice)
- Created `_SPEC_EDIRD_VARIATION_A_UNIFIED.md [EDIRD-SP02]` - single adaptive model
- Created `_SPEC_EDIRD_VARIATION_B_DUAL.md [EDIRD-SP03]` - two domain-optimized models
- Created `_INFO_EDIRD_VARIATION_COMPARISON.md [EDIRD-IN01]` - comparison analysis
- Decided: Unified model (A) with best ideas from Dual model (B)
- Extended AGEN-SP01 with 13 new verbs for SOLVE workflows
- Created `_SPEC_EDIRD_PHASE_MODEL_2.md [EDIRD-SP04]` - consolidated v2 spec with:
  - Unified BUILD/SOLVE workflow types
  - Comprehensive gate checklists for each phase transition
  - Next Action Logic for deterministic autonomous agent operation
  - Verb outcome transition handlers
  - Workflow flows for BUILD (HIGH/LOW) and SOLVE (EVALUATION/WRITING)
- Added Mini SOLVE POC note to Hybrid Situations section
- Created `_INFO_DEVSYSTEM_V3_MIGRATION.md [DSVS-IN01]` - migration challenges analysis:
  - Analyzed DevSystemV2.1 structure (4 rules, 20 workflows, 7 skills)
  - Identified 8 migration challenges (CH-01 through CH-08)
  - Proposed V3 structure with phase-based workflows
  - Recommended hybrid migration strategy
- Created `_IMPL_DEVSYSTEM_V3_MIGRATION.md [DSVS-IP01]` - migration plan:
  - 7 migration phases, 25 hours estimated effort
  - 14 implementation steps (IS-01 through IS-14)
  - 3 edge cases identified (EC-01 through EC-03)
  - Pilot workflow: implement.md
