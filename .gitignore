# Tools binaries moved to parent folder (../.tools/) - shared across workspaces
# Kept as safety net in case .tools/ is accidentally created in workspace
.tools/

# Private sessions folder (contents ignored, folder tracked)
# Pattern: ignore all contents (*) but negate (!) the .gitkeep file
# Result: folder visible in git/Cascade, but session files stay private

.tmp_*
*.tmp

# IDE (keep .vscode/ - shared config)
.vs/

# Python
